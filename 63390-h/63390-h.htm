<p class="pfs70">ARABIA AND ITS INHABITANTS.&mdash;LIFE AND DOCTRINE
OF MOHAMMED.</p>


<p>The Arabian peninsula, called by the natives <span class="smcap">Jesira-al-Arab</span>,
by the Persians and Turks <span class="smcap">Arabistan</span>, forms the
south-westernmost part of Asia. It is bounded on the
north by Syria and the river Euphrates, on the east by the
Persian Gulf, on the south by the Indian Ocean, on the
west by the Red Sea, or Arabian Gulf. Including the
north-eastern desert, it occupies an area ten times the extent
of that of Great Britain and Ireland. The connecting link
between Asia and Africa, to which latter continent it is
joined by the Isthmus of Suez, it presents in its natural
features, a faithful copy of its colossal tropical neighbour,
modified, however, by the imprint of a strongly marked
individual character, the result of its peculiar isolated position.
The attempted derivation of the name of the country
from <span class="smcap">Eber</span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, the common progenitor of the Joctanites and
Ismaelites&mdash;the two races which are assumed to constitute
the great bulk of the native population of Arabia&mdash;is, at the
best, but very problematical; that from the word <span class="smcap">Araba</span>, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
name of a district of the province of Tehama, and which
signifies a <em>level desert</em>, would seem to rest on a safer and
more rational foundation, the far greater part of the country
being indeed a dreary waste, a boundless level of sand,
destitute of rivers, intersected by naked mountains, and
barely relieved here and there by a shady grove or a green
sward of aromatic herbs. The date-palm is often the
solitary representative of vegetable life in these sterile tracts,
which are scorched by a tropical sun, and hardly ever refreshed
by a grateful shower. There are, however, some more
favored districts, where the fertile soil produces dates and
other palms, tamarinds, vines, rice, sugar, figs, tobacco,
indigo, cotton, durra,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> coffee, gum, benzoin, frankincense,
manna, balsam, aloe, myrrh, spices, &amp;c. The high lands in
the south-west, that border on the Indian Ocean, are
distinguished in this respect, above all other parts of
Arabia, by a more temperate air, superior fertility, and comparative
abundance of wood and water. No wonder, then,
that the appellation <em>happy</em>, bestowed upon this blessed
region by <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span>, should have been generally adopted,
although originating in a mistranslation of the word <span class="smcap">Yemen</span>,
the Arabian name of this part of the peninsula, and which
does not signify happy, but is simply meant to designate the
land lying, with respect to the East, to the right of <span class="smcap">Mecca</span>,
just as <span class="smcap">Al-Sham</span> (Syria) means the land to the left of that
city. <span class="smcap">Ptolemy’s</span> division of the country into the <em>sandy</em>, the
<em>petraie</em>, and the <em>happy</em> (<em>Arabia Deserta</em>, <em>Petræa</em>, and <em>Felix</em>),
is, however, unknown to the Arabians themselves, who speak
only of high land and low land. The epithet <em>stony</em>, so
generally applied by geographers to the petraic division, is
founded in error: <span class="smcap">Ptolemy</span> derived the word from <span class="smcap">Petra</span>,
the name of the then flourishing capital of the Nabathæans,
and not from the Greek word <em>petra</em>, a rock or stone.
Ptolemy’s Arabia Petræa forms now part of the province of
<span class="smcap">Hejaz</span>, along the coast of the Red Sea. <span class="smcap">Yemen</span>, as we
have seen, occupies the south-western coast. On the south-eastern
coast lies the maritime district of <span class="smcap">Oman</span>; on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
Persian Gulf, the district of <span class="smcap">Lahsa</span>: the inland space bears
the name of <span class="smcap">Neged</span>, or <span class="smcap">Naged</span>.</p>

<p>Arabia is the true native country of the horse, and remains
even at the present time the seat of the purest and noblest
races of that generous animal. Asses, oxen, sheep, goats,
and the swift gazelle, are also indigenous; and so is the
<em>camel</em>, the “ship of the desert,” nature’s most precious gift
in the sands of Africa and Arabia. Monkies, pheasants,
and pigeons inhabit the fertile districts. The lion, the
panther, the hyena, the jackal, lurk in the desert. Ostriches,
and pelicans are among the birds of Arabia; locusts, that
“plague of the fields,” are among its insects. The coasts
abound in fishes and tortoises; and the pearl-fishery
flourishes more especially in the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Among the mineral products may be mentioned iron,
copper, lead, coals, asphaltum; and precious stones, as the
agate, the onyx, the carnelion, &amp;c. Some of the ancient
geographers speak also of the soil of Arabia as being
impregnated with gold; and though no mines of that
precious metal are at present known in the peninsula, who
can say but that the treasures of another California lie
hidden there?</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Arabia, whose present number may be
estimated at about fifteen millions, are supposed to derive
their origin partly from <span class="smcap">Joctan</span> (in the Arabian language
<span class="smcap">Kahtan</span>), one of the sons of <span class="smcap">Eber</span>; and partly from <span class="smcap">Ismael</span>,
the son of Abraham and Hagar. The Joctanites, as the
supposed original inhabitants of the country, have been
called also true Arabians; the Ismaelites, as later immigrants,
<em>mixed</em> Arabians. The <span class="smcap">Ismaelites</span> are the <span class="smcap">Bedoweens</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Bedouins</span>, of our time, who to the present day continue to
rove through the interior and the north of Arabia, as they
did in the remote times of Job and Sesostris, depending
partly on their flocks, partly on the transit trade of the
caravans, but chiefly on plunder;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which latter is by these
wild sons of the desert looked upon in the light of an
honorable profession rather than of a disgraceful and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
criminal pursuit. They are a fine race of men, of middle
size, but well proportioned, vigorous, and active; they have
regular features; their complexion is mostly dark, rarely of
a lighter tint; their eyes sparkle with a fire and lustre
unknown among us. They are brave, temperate, generous,
and hospitable; enthusiastically addicted to eloquence and
poetry. Rapine and revenge are the only dark spots in the
national character of the Bedoween.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Joctanites</span> are the <span class="smcap">Haddhesies</span>, or <em>settled</em> Arabians,
who from the earliest times have been collected into towns
and villages, more especially in the maritime districts of the
peninsula, employed in the labors of agriculture, trade, and
commerce. Though the Arabian house-dwellers cannot be
said to possess all the noble qualities of their brethren of
the desert, still the description given above of the physical
and moral character of the latter applies in a great measure
equally to them; they are lively, intelligent, eloquent, and
witty; and, with all their habitual haughty demeanour, more
particularly to strangers, affable and agreeable in their
manners and conversation.</p>

<p>The principal nations of Arabia mentioned by the ancients,
are, besides the <span class="smcap">Skenites</span> (<em>tent-dwellers</em>, or wandering
tribes), the <span class="smcap">Nabathæans</span>, in Arabia Petræa (Hejaz); the
<span class="smcap">Thamudites</span> and <span class="smcap">Minæans</span> in Hejaz; the <span class="smcap">Sabæans</span> and
<span class="smcap">Homerites</span>, in Yemen; the <span class="smcap">Hadhramites</span>, in Hadhramaut
on the southern coast; the <span class="smcap">Omanites</span>, <span class="smcap">Dacharenians</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Gerrhæans</span>, in Oman and Ul-Ahsa, or Lahsa; the <span class="smcap">Saranians</span>,
in Neged; and the <span class="smcap">Saracens</span>, an obscure tribe on
the borders of Egypt, and remarkable only from the circumstance
that, perhaps from a fallacious<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> interpretation of the
meaning of the word,&mdash;viz: as intended to indicate an
Oriental situation&mdash;the application of the name has been
gradually extended, first to the inhabitants of the Arabian
peninsula generally, afterwards to all Mohammedans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>The early history of the Arabians is shrouded in obscurity.
That the <span class="smcap">Joctanites</span> were not the true original
inhabitants of the country, but simply later immigrants into
it, would appear to result from the histories of the ancient
Babylonian and Assyrian empires (however so little reliance
we may feel inclined to place in these mythical and
traditional histories); for we are told that Nimrod was
attended by Arabian tribes&mdash;and in the list of the Babylonian
kings we find six Arabian princes; and, again, among the
auxiliaries of Ninus we find Arabs, under a prince named
Ariæus. The <span class="smcap">Hyksos</span>, or Shepherd Kings, who are said to
have invaded Egypt about 2075 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and to have held sway
in that country during more than 500 years, are also generally
considered to have come from Arabia. The traditional
history of Arabia mentions several kingdoms and dynasties.
The two most ancient of these, dating their origin as far
back as 2000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, were, 1, the <span class="smcap">Homerite</span> kingdom in Yemen,
which, after a time, split into the two states of <span class="smcap">Saba</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Sheba</span>, and <span class="smcap">Hadhramaut</span>. About 1572 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, these were
re-united into one empire, which about 1075 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was
governed by <span class="smcap">Balkis</span>, the daughter of Hodhad, and who by
some historians is thought to have been identical with the
Queen of Sheba, the cotemporary of Solomon; 2, the State
in Hejaz, in which the <span class="smcap">Nabathæans</span> held superior sway.</p>

<p>Protected on all sides by the seas of sand and water which
encompass the peninsula, the Arabian people&mdash;or, at all events,
the great body of the nation&mdash;had, at all times, escaped the
yoke of a foreign conqueror. King Sesostris, of Egypt, is
said to have subjected some tribes of Hejaz to his rule; but
it would appear they speedily recovered their independence.
All the attempts made at different times, by the rulers of
Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, and Persia, to subjugate the
Arabian peninsula, proved either altogether abortive, or,
even where they partially succeeded, the conquest was only
transient. Thus Arabia Petræa was subjugated, for a time,
to the Assyrian sway in the eighth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> by Pul, or
Phul, and Sennacherib; but in the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> we
find it in independent alliance with the Persian kings
Cyrus and Cambyses. Alexander the Great had formed the
plan to conquer and colonise the coasts of Arabia, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
prepare in this way the ultimate subjugation of the entire
peninsula. The genius of the Græco-Macedonian conqueror,
the immense material means of which he could dispose, and
the possession of a powerful fleet (under Nearchus) promised
a successful issue to the intended expedition: the death of
Alexander (11th June, 323 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) averted the threatening
danger.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The attempt which Antigonus and Demetrius
made upon Arabia in 312 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> was a failure; and the trifling
conquest achieved in 219 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> by Antiochus the Great,
of Syria, was speedily wrested again from him by the
natives. At a later period, the northern tribes of Arabia
were engaged for a time, with varying fortunes, in desultory
feuds with the Jews under the Maccabæans, or Makkabi.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The Romans also, that all-grasping nation, cast their covetous
eyes upon the flourishing state of Petræa; but neither
Scaurus nor Gabinius, neither Pompey nor Antony, nor
even Augustus, could prevail against the difficulties of the
country, and the stubborn valor of the roving tribes of the
desert. Hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease thinned the
ranks of the proud legions more effectually still than the
bow, the javelin, and the scymetar of the Bedoween; and
after a last vain attempt under Ælius Gallus, Imperial Rome
reluctantly relinquished for a time the coveted prize. In
106 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, Cornelius Palma, a lieutenant of Trajan, conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the cities of Bostra and Petra, and subdued the Nabathæans.
Trajan made, also, some naval inroads, and carried his
incursions as far as Katif. Petra lost from this time its
importance and splendor; Bostra becoming in its stead
the principal seat of the commerce of the Euphrates and
the Tigris. After the death of Trajan, the conquered tribes
shook off again the Roman yoke. The Emperor Aurelian
broke, indeed, the power of the Nabathæans in his celebrated
campaign against Zenobia, the great Queen of Palmyra,
(272 and 273 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>), and his triumphal car was followed by
captive Arabian chiefs; but the Nabathæan <em>nation</em>, disdaining
to bend to the Roman yoke, abandoned their homes, and fled
to that great asylum of Arabian freedom, the desert.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the sixth century, (502 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>),
the Homerite kingdom of Yemen<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was conquered by an
Ethiopian prince, the Negus, or King, of Abyssinia,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
remained subject or tributary to the Christian princes of
the latter country to the time of the conquest of Arabia by
Chosroes I. (Nushirvan) of Persia (about 574 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). Still,
though Arabia was styled a Persian province, the sway of
the Sassanides over the peninsula was more nominal than
real: the tribes of the desert remained free, and even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Yemen, we find seven Princes of the Homerites successfully
asserting and maintaining the independence of their mountains.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>There is some reason to suppose that the original worship
of the Arabs was that of <em>one</em> God; clouded and tarnished,
indeed, by many superstitious usages, and perhaps even by
human sacrifices, yet free from gross idolatry. But this
primitive religion was speedily supplanted by the adoration
of the sun, the moon, and the fixed stars; a specious superstition
which substitutes for the invisible, all-pervading,
universal God, the most glorious of his creations, and may
well find its excuse in the clear sky and boundless naked
plains of Arabia, where the heavenly luminaries shine with
a brighter lustre, displaying to the mind of the untutored
son of the desert the visible image of a Deity. Intimately
connected with this still primitive faith, was the belief in
the wonderful powers and attributes of <em>meteoric stones</em>.
The most renowned of these, called Hadjar-el-Aswad, is a
square-shaped black stone, kept to the present day in Mecca
in the Temple of the <span class="smcap">Kaaba</span>, and which has from time
immemorial been, and remains still, the sacred object of
the devout pilgrimages and adoration of the Arabs of
all tribes. The Kaaba is a square building, thirty-four
feet high, and twenty-seven broad; built, according
to the Mohammedan tradition, by Abraham, and repeatedly
restored, in after ages, by the Amalekites, by the Jorhamites,
by Kassa, of the tribe of Koreish, &amp;c.; and the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
time by Sultan Mustapha, in 1630. Of the original
building there remains thus at present only a small portion
of wall, which is held most sacred. A spacious portico<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
encloses the quadrangle of the Kaaba. The holy stone,
which is about four feet high, and set in silver, is fixed in
the wall, in the southern corner. The Mohammedan tradition
relates that this stone was brought to Abraham by the
Angel Gabriel, whose tears over the sinfulness of man had
changed its original white color to black! Hence Mahomet
was induced to make it the Kebla<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of prayer, and to enjoin
the pilgrimage of the faithful to it and the Kaaba. Verily,
the idolatry of the ancient Arabs, who worshipped the divine
power in the <em>meteoric stone</em>, that had fallen from the skies in
a manner miraculous to their untutored understanding, was
more natural, and even far more rational, than the present
worship of the same stone, based upon this wretched and
most absurd legend! The transmigration of souls, the
resurrection of bodies, and the invocation of departed
spirits, formed also part of the religious belief of the
ancient Arabs; the cruel practice of human sacrifices
prevailed among them even up to the time of Mohammed,
in the course of time the grossest idolatry became an
important, and, in the end, a preponderating ingredient in
Arabian worship; and the sacred Kaaba was defiled by the
gradual introduction of three hundred and sixty idols of
men, eagles, lions, and antelopes; among which stood most
conspicuous the most popular of them, the statue of Hobal,
fashioned of red agate by a Syrian artist, and holding in his
hand seven arrows, without heads or feathers, the instruments
and symbols of profane divination.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>But, though each tribe, each family, nay every independent
warrior, might freely create new idols and new rites of his fantastic
worship, yet the nation, in every age, has bowed to the
religion of Mecca, and to the superior sanctity of the Kaaba.
An annual truce of two, or, according to some historians,
four months, during which the swords of the Arabs were
sheathed, both in foreign and domestic warfare, protected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the holy pilgrimage to Mecca. The great fair held in connection
with this pilgrimage induced those to come whom
religious ardor failed to attract. This annual gathering of
distant and hostile tribes contributed greatly to harmonise
and refine the wild sons of the desert; the exchange of
eloquence and poetry usual at these periods, could only
heighten the humanizing and elevating influence of the
custom. The fanaticism of the first Moslems abolished the
fair, inflicting thereby one of the many evils that came in the
train of Mohammed’s gigantic imposture. The rites which
are, even in the present day, accomplished by the devout
Moslems, are still the same they were in the days of the
ancient idolators of Arabia. “At a respectful distance from
the temple, they threw off their garments; seven times they
went round the Kaaba, with quick steps, kissing each time
the holy stone with deep reverence;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> seven times they visited
and adored the adjacent mountains; seven times they threw
stones into the valley of Mina: and the pilgrimage was
completed, as at the present hour, by a sacrifice of sheep
and camels, and the burial of their hair and nails in the
consecrated ground.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the custody of the
Kaaba must at all times have proved a most lucrative affair.
No wonder, then, that the neighbouring tribes should have
hotly contended for it. Originally the <span class="smcap">Ismaelites</span> held
it for a long time, together with the dominion over Mecca,
which resulted from it as a natural consequence. The
<span class="smcap">Jorhamites</span>, a branch of the Joctanites, succeeded at last
in ousting them from it; these again were expelled by the
<span class="smcap">Khuzaites</span>, who promoted idolatry to a most formidable
extent. In the middle of the fifth century, an Ismaelitic
tribe, that of <span class="smcap">Koreish</span>, wrested the custody of the Kaaba,
by fraud or force, from the Khuzaites. The sacerdotal
office was entrusted by the Koreish to <span class="smcap">Cosa</span>, of the
family of the <span class="smcap">Hashemites</span>, and devolved through four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
lineal descents to <span class="smcap">Abdol Motalleb</span>, the grandfather of
Mohammed.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The freedom which Arabia enjoyed, promised a safe
asylum to the political and religious exiles and proscripts
from the adjacent kingdoms. The intolerance of the
Magian Persians had overturned the altars of Babylon,
and compelled the votaries of Sabianism<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> to seek a refuge
in the desert. The <ins class="corr" id="tn-11" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'same fate befel'">
same fate befell</ins> the Magians in their
turn, when the sword of Alexander had overthrown the
Persian monarchy. Multitudes of Jews fled into Arabia,
to escape the cruel persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes,
and greater numbers still followed during the wars of Titus
and Hadrian. To all these were added, at a later period,
numerous sects of Christians, fleeing from that worst of all
persecutions, that of their triumphant co-religionists, from
whom they might chance to differ in some abstruse point
of doctrine, or in some immaterial rite. Among the
persecuted sects, we may mention here more particularly
the Marcionites and the Manichæans, the Jacobites and
Nestorians. The latter two sects had gained many proselytes
in Yemen, and succeeded even in converting the
princes of Hira and Gassan to their faith. The Jews, also,
had made numerous and important converts to the Mosaic
belief; and we have already seen how the intolerant zeal
of a bigoted Jewish neophyte, <span class="smcap">Dunaan</span>, prince of the
Homerites, suddenly interrupted the enjoyment of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
absolute liberty of conscience which the Arabian <em>idolaters</em>
had hitherto granted to all creeds and all sects, and brought
down upon Yemen an Abyssinian invasion to avenge the
wrongs of the persecuted Christians.</p>

<p>It was in this country, and among this people, so strangely
and peculiarly constituted, that arose the apostle of a new faith,
destined to knead the heterogeneous and hostile elements of
the nation into one compact mass, and to hurl this with
irresistible might against the adjacent empires, and even,
far beyond the limits of the latter, against countries and
nations formerly scarcely known by name even to the
Arabian merchant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mahomet</span>, or more properly <span class="smcap">Mohammed</span> or <span class="smcap">Muhammed</span>,
(i.e. <em>the very famous</em>), the only son of Abdallah and Amina,
was born at Mecca, on the 20th April, 571.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> His father,
<span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>, was the best beloved of the thirteen sons of
Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem, and chief of the family
of that name; his mother, Amina, sprang from the noble
race of the Zahrites. He had the misfortune to lose in his
infancy, his father and mother, and his grandfather. His
sole inheritance consisted in a house, an old female slave,
and five camels. After the death of his grandfather, he
was taken into the house of his uncle, Abu Taleb, who had
succeeded Abdol Motalleb in the sacerdotal office. Here
he was educated to commercial pursuits; and was, at the
age of thirteen, sent with the caravan of his uncle to the
fairs of Bosra, or Bostra,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and Damascus, in Syria. In his
twentieth year<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> he fought in the ranks of the Koreish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
against some hostile tribes, and, by his valor, gained the
appellation <span class="smcap">El Amin</span>, i.e., <em>the faithful</em>, one of the five hundred
and more surnames that have gradually been given to
the Prophet of Islam. In his twenty-fifth year, Cadijah, a
rich and noble widow of Mecca (according to some historians,
of Bosra), engaged him as superintendent and manager to
carry on the commercial affairs of her late husband. In
this capacity he made a second journey to the fairs of Bosra
and Damascus.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Nature had bestowed upon Mohammed the gift of
personal beauty. His cotemporaries describe him as of
commanding figure and majestic aspect; he had regular and
most expressive features, piercing black eyes, an aquiline
nose, and a well-formed mouth, with pearly teeth; his
cheeks were tinged with the ruddy glow of robust health.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
Art had imparted to his naturally black, flowing hair
and beard a lighter chestnut hue. His captivating smile,
his rich and sonorous voice, the graceful dignity of his
gestures, the apparent frankness and heartiness of his
manner, gained him the favorable attention of those whom
he addressed. He possessed talents of a superior order&mdash;his
perception was quick and active, his memory capacious
and retentive, his imagination lively and daring, his judgment
clear, rapid, and decisive, his courage dauntless;&mdash;and,
whatever may be our opinion of the sincerity of his
convictions, his tenacity of purpose in the pursuit of the
great object of his life, and his patient endurance, cannot
but extort our admiration. His natural eloquence was
enhanced by the use of the purest dialect of Arabia, and
adorned by the charm of a graceful elocution.</p>

<p>Cadijah was a widow for the second time; she was in the
fortieth year of her age&mdash;no wonder then, that a man so
bountifully endowed by nature should speedily have gained
her affection. She bestowed upon him her hand and her
fortune, and restored him thereby to the station of his
ancestors. Placed, henceforth, above the petty wants and
cares of material subsistence, Mohammed had now full
leisure to indulge his love of poetry and eloquence, and his
natural predilection for contemplation. His marriage
brought him into familiar contact with <span class="smcap">Waraka (Verka)
Ben Naufil</span>, a cousin of Cadijah. This Waraka, it would
appear, had first exchanged the adoration of the heavenly
bodies for the belief in the two principles of Zoroaster,
(Ormuzd and Ahriman). This creed not satisfying his mind,
he had embraced with fervor the monotheism of the Jews;
but, disgusted with the absurdities of the Talmudists, he had
seceded to the profession of the Christian faith, in which he
had even assumed the priestly office. That he must have
been a man of some talent and learning, is evident from the
fact of his having translated the Old and New Testament
from the Hebrew into the Arabic tongue. Now this man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
is usually mentioned by the historians of the time as the
<em>pupil</em> of Mohammed, and the <em>second convert</em> to his new
doctrine; but there are strong reasons to justify a belief
that he was his <em>master</em> and <em>teacher</em>, rather than his <em>pupil</em> and
<em>convert</em>.</p>

<p>It has been intimated already, that the history of the life
of Mohammed, up to the time when he proclaimed himself
the apostle of a new faith, is obscure and doubtful. From
the scanty data, and the conjectural and contradictory
statements before us, we can only gather one fact as pretty
certain, viz: that the prophet of Islam had enjoyed some
rabbinical and priestly instruction. Now we have seen that
Mohammed was an illiterate barbarian, and not likely,
therefore, to derive from conversation with priests in foreign
lands that knowledge of the maxims, tenets, and traditions
of other religious communities, which is evidenced in the
Koran and in the Sonna;<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> whereas Waraka had actually
had a practical training in the divers beliefs of the Sabians,
Magians, Jews, and Christians; and must, to judge by his
translation of the New Testament, have been tolerably
versed in the <em>letter</em>, at least, of the doctrine of Christ.
From his repeated, and apparently conscientious, changes
of faith, we have, perhaps, a right to conclude that he was
a man sincerely in search of a religion that might satisfy
his mind; nor need we wonder that the so-called “Christianity”
of the seventh century should have failed to answer
his expectations on this head. It would not be too much
to say, indeed, that there existed really no “Christian”
church at that period; the multitudinous contending sects
who professed the <em>name</em> of Christ had almost entirely forgotten
his <em>pure doctrine</em>, and, more especially, the divine
principle preached by him of universal charity and good-will
to all men. The grossest idolatry had usurped the place of
the simple worship, instituted by Jesus, of an All-wise,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
Almighty, and All-beneficent Being, without equal and
without similitude; a new Olympus had been imagined,
peopled with a crowd of martyrs, saints, and angels, in lieu
of the ancient gods of paganism. There were found Christian
sects impious enough to invest the wife of Joseph with the
honors and attributes of a goddess;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> relics, and carved and
painted images, were objects of the most fervid adoration on
the part of those whom the word of Christ commanded to
address their prayer to the Living God alone.</p>

<p>Surely, then, we may trust that it will not be imputed to
us as a violation of the laws of probability, if we venture to
assume that Waraka, finding his religious aspirations disappointed
even in the Christian faith, conceived the idea of
founding and propagating a doctrine of his own,&mdash;a species of
eclectic extract from all other religions which he had
successively professed; that, void perhaps of personal ambition,
or conscious, rather, that he did not himself possess the
most indispensable attributes and qualities of a religious and
political reformer, he cast his eyes upon Mohammed, who,
with his mind <ins class="corr" id="tn-16" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'attuned to comtemplation'">
attuned to contemplation</ins> and to mystic
thought, promised to prove a docile disciple, and whose
personal beauty and grace seemed made to “persuade ere he
ope’d his mouth;” and that he chose him as his organ, as
the medium through which he might give currency to the
coinage of his mind, content if the people would receive the
fruits of his religious experience and ponderings as a new
gospel, and cheerfully consenting to yield up the honors of
the paternity to him who should succeed in rearing the infant
religion.</p>

<p>Waraka found in Mohammed a most zealous disciple, who
considerably bettered the instructions which he received.
From what we can gather from the scanty sources of information
at our command, we think we may fix upon the
year 606 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> as the period at which Mohammed first became
the pupil of Waraka; but it was only five years after, in
611, that Waraka and himself had fully matured their plan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
to institute a new religion. Worthily to prepare himself
for the assumption of the prophetic and apostolic office,
Mohammed withdrew this year (as he had indeed done
repeatedly before), several weeks, during the month of Ramadan,
to the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca. On the
morning of the 24th Ramadan, Mohammed appeared before
his wife, apparently greatly disturbed in mind. He called
out to her to “wrap him up, to affuse him with cold water,
as his soul was greatly troubled.” Having thus prepared
her for his purpose, by exciting at once both her conjugal
solicitude and her female curiosity, he proceeded to break to
the amazed matron the great secret of his divine mission.
He told her the angel Gabriel had, that night, appeared to
him with a message from the Most High, appointing him,
Mohammed, the sixth, greatest, and last of His chosen
prophets,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to reveal His existence and to preach His law to
the nations of the world. The angel had brought down
with him a paper copy of the uncreated and eternal Koran,
enclosed in a volume of silk and gems, and had proposed to
reveal to him successively and at his (Mohammed’s) own
discretion, the chapters and verses of that everlasting
record of the law of God.</p>

<p>Islam (i.e. <em>devout submission to the Divine Will</em>) he had
been commanded by the angel to call the new faith which it
was to be henceforward his mission to preach; and which,
to use the felicitous language of Gibbon, is compounded of
an eternal truth&mdash;viz., that <em>there is only one God</em>&mdash;and of a
fiction necessary to further the ambitious designs of the
self-appointed missionary of this new gospel&mdash;viz., that
<em>Mohammed is the apostle and prophet of God</em>. Cadijah
believed readily and implicitly&mdash;and no marvel either.
Mohammed, to his honor be it written, had proved a most
kind and attentive husband to the elderly matron who had
raised him above the pressure of want. He had abstained&mdash;and
till her death continued to abstain&mdash;from availing
himself of the right of polygamy. He had proved his <em>truth</em>
to her by unvarying affection. How, then, could she possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
have doubted his word? To her grateful and loving eyes,
he must have seemed more than a mere mortal; and she
may even have deemed it by no means extraordinary that
the Most High should appoint as his organ and missionary
one so pure, so good, so <em>perfect</em>, as her husband appeared in
<em>her</em> sight.</p>

<p>Cadijah’s conversion was speedily followed by the avowed
declaration of Waraka in favor of the new doctrine. The
ex-priest of Christ professed to see in Mohammed the
<em>Paraclete</em>, or Comforter, promised in the Gospel, and even
ventured to support this view upon etymological grounds
of somewhat extraordinary character. The Arabic word
<em>Mohammed</em> is synonymous with the Greek περικλῠτὸς (i.e.
<em>very famous</em>), which, by an easy change of letters, may be
turned into παράκλητος!</p>

<p>The next converts to Mohammed’s new faith were, his
servant <span class="smcap">Zeid</span>, who was positively bribed to it by the promise
of freedom; his youthful cousin <span class="smcap">Ali Ben Abu Taleb</span>, a
boy of eleven, and not likely, therefore, to entertain any very
deep religious conviction either way; and the wealthy and
universally esteemed <span class="smcap">Abdallah Ben Othman-al-Koreish</span>,
called afterwards <span class="smcap">Abu Bekr</span> (i.e. <em>the father of the maiden</em>);
most probably from the circumstance that his daughter
<span class="smcap">Ayesha</span>, born 613, became one of Mohammed’s wives after
the death of Cadijah. By the weight and influence of Abu
Bekr, ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca were
induced to join the creed of Islam, among whom were
Othman, who became afterwards Mohammed’s son-in-law.
It had taken three years to accomplish these fourteen private
conversions; and, guided probably by the advice of Waraka,
the prophet had not yet ventured upon a public profession
and propaganda of his creed. In the beginning of 615, however,
Waraka died; and the bolder spirit of Mohammed, freed
from the restraining influence hitherto exercised by that
cautious man, aspired henceforward openly to the dignity
of the apostolic office.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Mohammed had informed
Cadijah, and, of course, also his other disciples, that the
chapters of the Koran were to be communicated to him by
the angel Gabriel successively, and at his own discretion,&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
master-stroke of policy evidently designed by the crafty
Waraka to afford full time for the gradual concoction of the
new creed, and worked out afterwards with such admirable
skill by his illustrious pupil; indeed, the ingenuity of this
provision may be said to be surpassed only by that of another
saving maxim introduced into the angelic revelation, viz.,
that any text of the Koran is abrogated or modified by any
subsequent passage,&mdash;which, of course, at once removed the
inconvenience of contradictory texts. Gabriel was accordingly
now made to descend again to Mohammed, and to
command him in the name of the Most High to throw off the
reserve which he had hitherto maintained, and to announce
his mission in the open light of day. In obedience to this
pretended command, the prophet of Islam invited forty
members of the race of Hashem to a banquet. He placed
before them, it is said, a lamb and a bowl of milk, and, after
the frugal meal, addressed them as follows:&mdash;“Friends and
kinsmen, I offer you, and I alone can offer, the most precious
of gifts&mdash;the treasures of this world and of the world to come.
God has commanded me to call you to His service. Who
among you will support my burthen? Who among you will
be my companion and my vizir?” A long silence of doubt
and amazement followed this extraordinary allocution; it
was broken at last by the impetuous Ali, then in the fourteenth
year of his age. “O prophet!” he cried, “I am the
man: whosoever rises against thee, I will dash out his teeth,
tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his belly. O prophet!
I will be thy vizir over them.” This response on the part of
one so young, and the fierce threats which it contained,
excited the merriment of the assembly, which was increased
when Mohammed fervently embraced his young cousin,
and declared most seriously that he accepted his offer. Abu
Taleb, the father of Ali, was ironically exhorted to respect
the superior dignity of his son, and to take care not to
provoke his potent wrath. The prince of Mecca took the
matter in a more serious light: he advised his nephew to
relinquish his design, which he characterised as impious.
“Spare your remonstrances,” replied the son of Abdallah;
“were you to place the sun on my right hand and the moon
on my left, you should not divert me from my course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>Braving the ridicule and the anger of the Hashemites, as
well as the more determined and malignant hostility of the
family Ommiyah and the other branches of the Koreish,
Mohammed preached his doctrine henceforward publicly,
with unflinching courage and untiring zeal, but for a long
time with rather indifferent success, at least so far as his
native city was concerned.</p>

<p>Mecca was the sacred city of Arabia,&mdash;the seat of the great
national temple. The annual pilgrimage of the devout
Arabians to the shrines of the Kaaba, brought wealth to the
coffers of the inhabitants of the favored city; and it was but
natural, therefore, that the tribe of Koreish, who held the
lucrative office of custodians of the sacred temple, should
behold with indignation and dismay the attempt made by
one from among themselves to subvert a religion so profitable
to their interests. No wonder, then, that when
Mohammed, some time after the banquet of the Hashemites,
ventured to proclaim his pretended mission before a general
assembly of the Koreish, he was received with a perfect
storm of disapprobation, and ignominiously pelted with mud
and stones.</p>

<p>But the prophet of Islam was not the sort of man to be
readily diverted from his fixed purpose. The indifferent
success of his first public attempt rather increased his zeal
than otherwise: in private converse and in public discourse,
he incessantly urged the belief and worship of a sole Deity.
He addressed impassioned orations to the citizens and pilgrims
gathered within the holy precincts of the Kaaba, and
the loudest clamor of his most violent antagonists did not
always succeed in silencing his potent voice; and, indeed,
after a time he had the satisfaction of beholding the gradual
but steady increase of his little congregation of Unitarians.
But the hostility of the Koreish assumed now a more decided
and more dangerous character; and, had it not been for the
powerful protection of Abu Taleb, who, though an uncompromising
enemy to the attempted innovation of his nephew,
continued to bestow on the son of Abdallah the affection of a
parent, Mohammed would most probably have fallen a sacrifice
to the rage of his enemies. But even the weight and influence
of the Prince of Mecca could not always fully secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
the safety of the apostle of the new creed, and Mohammed
was repeatedly compelled to withdraw himself to various
places of strength in the town and country. The more timid
of his disciples were forced to seek in Ethiopia an asylum
from the violence of religious faction. The conversion of
his uncle <span class="smcap">Hamza</span>, gave the new faith, most opportunely, a
powerful support in the family of Hashem; a perhaps still
more important acquisition was made in the person of the
fierce and inflexible <span class="smcap">Omar</span>, the <span class="smcap">Paul</span> of Islam. On the other
hand, the branch of Ommiyah, and the rest of the tribe of
Koreish, resolved to put the children of Hashem under a
species of religious and civil interdict of the most stringent
nature, till they should consent to deliver the person of
Mohammed to the justice of the insulted gods. A decree
was passed to this effect, and was suspended in the Kaaba
before the eyes of the nation; the prophet and his most
faithful followers were besieged, and subjected to the greatest
hardships. A hollow truce had scarcely restored the appearance
of concord, when the death of Abu Taleb (621) left
the prophet abandoned to the power of his enemies, and
compelled him to seek a refuge in Tayef, whither he proceeded,
attended by his faithful Zeid. His somewhat
incautious attempts to propagate his creed in that land of
grapes excited against him the indignation of the inhabitants,
who pelted him with stones and drove him back to
Mecca, where he was permitted to dwell yet a little while
under the protection of an influential citizen. Three days
after the death of Abu Taleb, an equally severe loss had
befallen Mohammed&mdash;that of Cadijah, by which the ties
which bound him to his native city were greatly loosened.</p>

<p>It is in this period that we may place the miraculous night
of Mohammed’s ascension to heaven. Hitherto, Mohammed
had been modestly content to place an intermediary
between the Deity and himself. Probably reflecting, however,
that the Jewish creed asserted direct and personal
converse between Jehovah and Adam, Noah, Abraham, and
Moses, and that he, the greatest and last of the prophets,
and whose doctrine was to supersede all others, could not
well afford to stand inferior in this respect to his predecessors,
and anxiously desirous, moreover, to gain over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Jews, whom he wished to believe him the promised Messiah&mdash;he
put forth one of the wildest flights of fancy that ever
issued even from an Oriental brain:&mdash;A mysterious animal,
the <em>Borak</em> (the cherub of Islam), with human face, the ears
of an elephant, the neck of a camel, the body of a horse, the
tail of a mule, and the hoofs of a bullock, conveyed him at
the dead of night from the temple of Mecca to that of Jerusalem,
Gabriel and legions of angels attended him. From
the temple of Jerusalem he was carried to the rock upon
which Abraham intended to sacrifice Isaac, and thence on
the wings of Gabriel successively to the seven heavens, where
he exchanged civilities with the patriarchs, the prophets, and
the angels. He saw the heavenly Lotos tree, with the four
springs under it, flowing with water, honey, milk, and wine.
Of the three former he tasted; the last he left untouched, in
obedience to his own precepts.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He saw, also, the heavenly
tabernacle, pitched in a straight line above the Kaaba, and
hidden by a golden veil. The angels sang, “There is only
one God, and Mohammed is the prophet of God.” The
same resounded from behind the veil, and the voice of the
Lord was heard saying, “My servants speak the words of
truth; Mohammed is indeed the most beloved of my prophets
and apostles, the most pious of my servants, the most perfect
of created beings.” Beyond this part, Mohammed alone was
permitted to proceed; he passed through seventy thousand
veils of light and darkness, each of them a thousand years
thick, and with a space of a thousand years intervening
between every two of them. At last he reached the green
barrier of green light with emerald lustre; he passed the veil
of the Divine unity, and approached within two bow-shots of
the throne of the Almighty, where he prostrated himself and
adored. The hand of the Lord touched his shoulder, which
made a sensation of cold come over him that pierced him to
the heart. God commanded him now to impose upon his disciples
the daily obligation of fifty prayers; which Mohammed
would appear to have looked upon as an intolerable burthen,
since he pleaded hard for an alleviation of it.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> By his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
supplications he succeeded to reduce it, step by step, at last to
the number of five, viz., one prayer at daybreak, one at noon,
one in the afternoon, one in the evening, and one at the first
watch of the night; but from these five obligatory prayers
there was to be no dispensation of business or pleasure, of
time or place. In this most important conversation, the
Lord enjoined or sanctioned, also, the annual pilgrimage to
Mecca, the bestowal of a certain percentage of the property
or revenue of a believer for the relief of the indigent and
unfortunate, and the thirty days fast during the month of
Ramadan. Then was given to Mohammed, with one drop
from the throne, all wisdom, science, and knowledge of the
ages past and the time to come; and the angelic choirs recited
the two articles of belief, “There is only one God, and
Mohammed is the apostle of God.” Mohammed was then
finally dismissed; he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted
the Borak, and returned to Mecca, having thus performed in
the tenth part of a night the journey of many thousand years.
Verily, in this precious tale we do not know which to admire
most,&mdash;whether the audacity of the impostor who could concoct,
or the gross credulity of the people who could believe it!
Indeed, many endeavours have been made by some of the
more rational of the Mohammedan doctors to deny that the
prophet of Islam ever ventured to palm off this extravagant
story upon his followers; and it has been attempted to make
it appear that the narration of it relates to a mere dream or
vision. These apologists overlook, however, the important
fact that this pretended vision was put forward with all the
authority of a divine revelation. Mohammed himself encouraged
as much as in him lay the belief in the actual occurrence
of the fact; which, with the Sonnites, indeed, is an
article of faith, the pious <span class="smcap">Al Jannabi</span>, among others,
declaring that to deny this nocturnal journey of the prophet
is to disbelieve the Koran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abu Sophian</span>, the chief of the branch of Ommiyah, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the mortal foe of the line of Hashem, had succeeded to the
principality of the republic of Mecca. This man resolved
to bring the long-pending contest between the Koreish and
the self-appointed apostle of the new creed to a speedy and
decisive issue. He convened an assembly of the Koreishites
and their allies, in which the death of Mohammed was
resolved. To baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites, it was
agreed that the guilt of his blood should be divided among
the several tribes. A spy (duly converted afterwards into
an angel by the crafty prophet) revealed the odious plot to
Mohammed, who resolved on flight as the only means of
escape from the malice of his enemies. In the night of the
13th September, 622,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Mohammed, accompanied by his friend
Abu Bekr, escaped silently from his house, whilst the assassins,
who were watching at the door, were deceived by the
figure of Ali, who, covered with the green vestment of the
apostle, reposed on the bed, securing thus, at the risk of his
own life, the safe retreat of his illustrious and beloved
cousin. When the deception practised upon them was at
length revealed, the Koreishites dismissed the heroic youth
unharmed.</p>

<p>Mohammed and the companion of his flight took refuge
first in the cave of Thor, about three miles from Mecca.
Three days they remained concealed there, receiving every
evening from the son and daughter of Abu Bekr a supply of
food, and intelligence of the movements of their enemies.
The Koreish explored every hiding-place in the neighbourhood
of the city, with the exception of the cave in which the
fugitives were hidden, and which the pious Moslem doctors
would have us believe was protected from their scrutiny by
the providential deceit of a spider’s web and a pigeon’s nest.
When the first rigor of the pursuit had somewhat abated,
the fugitives left the protection of their cave, and mounted
their camels to pursue their flight to <span class="smcap">Yathreb</span>, called afterwards
<span class="smcap">Medina</span>, or <span class="smcap">Medina al Nabi</span> (i.e. <em>city of the prophet</em>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
On the road, they were overtaken by the emissaries
of the Koreish, who were, however, diverted from their
murderous purpose by the eloquent appeals of the prophet:
indeed it is stated by the Arabian historians that one of his
pursuers passed over to him with seventy followers, and
attended him to Medina.</p>

<p>The city of Yathreb was inhabited chiefly by the tribes of
the <span class="smcap">Charegites</span> and the <span class="smcap">Awsites</span>, and by two colonies of
Jews, of a sacerdotal race, and who had introduced among
their Arab fellow-citizens a taste for science and religion,
which had gained Medina the name of the City of the Book.
Now whether it might be that, owing to this circumstance, the
preaching of Mohammed had made a deeper impression upon
the pilgrims and merchants from Medina than upon his own
fellow-citizens in Mecca; or that the Yathrebites, who were
envious of the flourishing commerce of the latter city, would
gladly avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the
bigoted zeal of the Koreish to attract to their own city the
exiled disciples of Mohammed, and in fine perhaps that illustrious
man himself&mdash;certain it is that at an early period of
Mohammed’s mission, some of the noblest citizens of Medina,
in a pilgrimage to the Kaaba, had been converted by his
preaching, and had upon their return home diffused among
their fellow-citizens the belief of God and his prophet. The
Charegites and Awsites had hitherto lived in perpetual feud,
interrupted only by temporary truces, which were broken on
the slightest provocation. By the exhortations of these
missionaries, the two tribes were henceforth united in faith
and love. Ten Charegites and two Awsites were despatched
to Mecca, where they held a secret and nocturnal interview
with Mohammed on a hill in the suburbs; they protested
for themselves and in the name of their wives, their children,
and their absent brethren, an inviolable attachment to the
person and doctrine of the prophet. At a later period,
shortly before Mohammed’s forced departure from Mecca,
seventy-three men and two women of Medina came to Mecca,
and held a solemn conference with Mohammed, his kinsmen,
and his disciples, on the same spot where the interview with
the first embassy had taken place. They promised the
prophet in the name of their city that should he be com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>pelled
to leave Mecca, they would receive him as their prince,
and would place their lives and fortunes at his service for
the defence and propagation of the new faith preached by
him. Mohammed on his part promised never to abandon
his new allies, even though the Koreish should repent and
should recall him; he declared their blood to be as his blood,
their ruin as his ruin, their friends as his friends, their foes
as his foes; should they fall in his service, Paradise was to
be their reward. A solemn league and covenant was made
there and then between the two parties; this was ratified
by the people of Medina, who, with the exception of the
Jews, unanimously embraced the profession of Islam.</p>

<p>It was accordingly to Medina that the exiled prophet
directed his steps. After a rapid though perilous journey
along the sea-coast, he reached Medina sixteen days after his
flight from Mecca. He was received with acclamations of
loyalty and devotion; his disciples who at various times had
fled from Mecca, gathered round his person. To eradicate
the seeds of jealousy that might spring up between the
Moslems of his native city, and his new allies of Medina,
he judiciously established a holy brotherhood between his
principal followers, coupling always a <span class="smcap">Mohagerian</span>, or
fugitive of Mecca, with an <span class="smcap">Ansar</span>, or auxiliary of Medina.
It so falling out that Ali found himself without a peer, the
prophet declared himself the companion and brother of the
noble youth.</p>

<p>Mohammed assumed now the exercise of the regal and
sacerdotal office. He acquired by purchase a small piece of
ground, on which he built a house and a mosque. The
loyalty and devotion of his followers, and the unhesitating
compliance and obedience which his decrees met with on the
part of the inhabitants of Medina, convinced him that he
was indeed the absolute prince and ruler of that city. But
with this conviction the range of his ambition widened, he
resolved to extend his creed and his power over all the
tribes of Arabia, and even beyond the limits of his native
land. He now threw off the cloak of toleration in which
he had so carefully enfolded himself at Mecca. <em>There</em> he
had asserted the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the
use of religious violence; <em>here</em>, at Medina, he preached a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
war of extermination against whomsoever should continue
in idolatry.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The commands and precepts, which Gabriel
was now made to transmit to him, breathed a fierce and
sanguinary spirit; the creed of Islam was to be propagated
henceforth by the sword, and the unbelieving nations of the
earth were to be pursued without mercy. To excite in his
followers a spirit of martial ardor, he proclaimed the
superior sanctity of the sword. “In the shade of the
crossing scymitars Paradise is prefigured,” says Mohammed;
“the sword is the key of heaven and of hell: a drop of blood
shed in the cause of God, a night spent in arms, is of more
avail than two months of fasting or prayer. Whosoever
falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at the day of judgment
his wounds shall be resplendent as rubies, and odoriferous
as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be supplied by the
wings of angels and cherubim.” Paradise was the glorious
reward of the faithful who fell in battle, and death might
thus actually become an object of hope and desire rather
than of dread. Moreover, as the Koran inculcates also, in
the most absolute sense, the tenets of fate and predestination,
it would be little use for the devout Moslem to shirk
his military duties through fear of being wounded or killed
in battle, since his preordained fate would be sure to
overtake him, even in his bed. And as Paradise was the
portion of the fallen hero, so wealth and beauty rewarded
the warrior who had escaped the dangers of the fight: the
apostle gave his followers the license of embracing the
female captives as their wives or concubines; he regulated
by a law, divine, of course, like all the rest of his laws and
precepts, the distribution of the spoil taken in battle, or in
a conquered place: the whole was faithfully collected in one
common mass, one-fifth of it was reserved for the prophet
himself (doubtless, for pious and charitable uses), the
remainder was shared among the soldiers, the shares of the
slain devolving to their widows and orphans: a horseman
received double the share of a foot-soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>From the first months of his reign, he prepared for the
holy warfare against Jews, Christians, and idolators. At the
beginning of the year 623, his white banner was displayed
before the gates of Medina. Faithful to the national
character, he, the holy prophet of a creed which the nations
of the world were invited to look upon as divine, went
forth at the head of his pious followers, the future denizens
of a Paradise which in his extravagant Oriental fancy he
had placed beyond the seventh heaven, to waylay the
peaceful merchant, and to rob and maim, or murder him, in
the name and for the glory of the Most High.</p>

<p>So he went forth at the head of three hundred and
thirteen Moslems, to intercept the return of the great
caravan from Syria to Mecca, a caravan of a thousand
camels, led by Abu Sophian, with only thirty or forty
followers. But the Koreish, alarmed for the safety of their
merchandise and their provisions, hastened to the rescue.
One hundred horse, and eight hundred and fifty foot,
advanced from Mecca to about three stations from Medina.
Here, in the fertile and famous vale of Beder, they met the
band of the prophet. The disproportion of numbers was
great; in Mohammed’s ranks were found only two horsemen:
informed by his scouts that the caravan was
approaching from the one, the Koreish from the other side,
Mohammed had hesitated whether to seize upon an easy
prey, or to venture on an encounter with vastly superior
forces; but the reflection, that a success gained under
disadvantageous circumstances, would, with an impulsive
people like the Arabs, go far to prove his divine mission,
and would embolden his adherents and discourage his
enemies, he resolved to give battle. With Abu Bekr by his
side, he took his station on a kind of throne or pulpit. The
white veil of Ayesha, and two black banners, were borne
before his host. “Courage, my children,” he exclaimed,
“close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day is
your own.” Perceiving, however, that the Moslems fainted
in their onset, and were hard pressed by the superior
numbers of the Koreish, he betook himself with a loud
voice to pray the succour of Gabriel and a <em>legion</em> of angels.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
He then started from his throne, mounted his horse, and,
casting a handful of sand into the air, exclaiming, “Let
their faces be covered with confusion,” dashed against
the hostile ranks. The Arabs were a most superstitious
people; their fancy beheld the angelic warriors, or rather
<em>felt</em> their presence; the thunder of Mohammed’s voice
revived the drooping spirits of his followers; whilst it
carried confusion into the ranks of his enemies. The
Koreish turned and fled. Seventy of the bravest were
slain, and seventy captives fell into the hands of the
victorious prophet, who had two of them put to death as a
trifling instalment of the debt of revenge which he meant
to exact from his foes and revilers. The other sixty-eight
were restored for a ransom of four thousand drachms of
silver. From the field of Beder, Mohammed started in
pursuit of Abu Sophian’s caravan, which, despite of the
swiftness of its flight, and the skill of its guides, was overtaken
and captured. A booty of 100,000 drachms of silver
rewarded the pious robbers. But this great success had
well nigh proved fatal to Mohammed and his creed, and to
the city of refuge. The fierce resentment of Abu Sophian
and of the Koreish, brought into the field against
Mohammed a body of three thousand men, among whom
were seven hundred armed with cuirasses, and two hundred
on horseback; three thousand camels attended the march of
this host. Abu Sophian advanced to within six miles of the
north of Medina, where he encountered the prophet at the
head of nine hundred and fifty followers, on Mount Ohud,
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 624). The Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent.
The right wing of the cavalry was led by Kaled, the fiercest
and most redoubtable of the Arab warriors. Mohammed
had made his dispositions with considerable skill; his troops
were successful at first, and broke the centre of the enemy;
but their eagerness to seize upon the spoils threw their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
ranks into disorder, and speedily deprived them of the
advantage gained. Kaled, with his cavalry, attacked them
in the flank and rear; Mohammed was wounded in the face
with a javelin, and two of his teeth were shattered with a
stone; Kaled exclaimed, with a loud voice, that the lying
prophet was slain; and the followers of Islam, who looked
in vain for the appearance of Gabriel and his angelic legion,
to avenge the fall of “The beloved of God,” trembled and
fled; still, in the midst of tumult and dismay, was heard
the thunder of Mohammed’s voice, denouncing the impious
tribe of the Koreish, as the murderers of God’s apostle,
and calling down upon them the vengeance of heaven.
Some of the most devoted followers of the prophet gathered
bravely around him, and conveyed him to a place of safety.
Seventy of the bravest defenders of Islam lay dead on the
field, among them <span class="smcap">Hamza</span>, one of Mohammed’s uncles.
The inhuman females of Mecca, who had accompanied the
expedition, mangled their bodies, and the fierce <span class="smcap">Henda</span>,
Abu Sophian’s wife, tasted the entrails of Hamza, with the
relish of a cannibal. But Mohammed was not discouraged:
his wounds had hardly been dressed, when the convenient
Gabriel revealed to him that (for some unexplained cause)
the powers of darkness had been permitted to prevail against
him this once, and that Satan himself had fought in the
ranks of the Koreish; he was, however, exhorted to
persevere in his propaganda, and was assured of ultimate
success. He rallied his troops, and even as early as the
next day he led them forth again to battle; on this occasion
the fight was, however, only of a desultory character, no
great harm being done on either side. Still the result of it
was, that the Koreish, having experienced the desperate
valor of the Moslems, and more particularly of Ali and
Omar, despaired of carrying Medina with their present
forces, and retired to Mecca. But in the ensuing year
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 625) Abu Sophian, having formed a league between the
Koreish and several tribes of the desert, led a well-appointed
host of ten thousand warriors against Medina. The number
of the Mussulmans, however, had also considerably increased,
and Mohammed’s army of three thousand men, awaited
the attack of their foes, securely encamped before the city,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and protected by a ditch and some field-works, which had
been constructed under the guidance and superintendence
of a Persian engineer. A general engagement being prudently
declined by the prophet, the hostilities were confined
to a number of single combats, in which Ali more especially
signalised his formidable strength and prowess. Twenty days
passed away in this desultory warfare, the apostle of God
having, meanwhile, recourse to every artifice that his crafty
mind could devise, to sow disunion in the camp of his
enemies. A tempest of wind, rain, and hail, which overturned
the tents of the besiegers, and which was, of course,
duly claimed as a direct interposition of God in favor of his
prophet, put the finishing stroke to the success of this
insidious policy: the Koreish, deserted by their allies, were
compelled to retire, and to relinquish, henceforth, the
attempt to overcome Mohammed by force of arms. This
last attack upon Medina is variously named from the <em>nations</em>
which marched under Abu Sophian’s banner, and from the
<em>ditch</em> which protected the Mussulman camp.</p>

<p id="jews">During the earlier period of his mission, Mohammed had
shown considerable leaning towards the Jews; he had
selected Jerusalem for the <em>Kebla</em> of prayer, and had endeavoured
to form most of his tenets and precepts upon the
model of the Mosaic ordinances. Indeed, there can be no
doubt, but that it was for a time the great end and object
of his ambition to be accepted by the Jews as their promised
Messiah; nor can it be denied, that a deep political idea
lay at the bottom of this desire. Had he succeeded in
persuading the Jews to believe in his Messiahship, his
apostolic course among the Arabs would have run much
smoother, and many of the so-called Christian sects might
have been readily gained over to his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mixtum compositum</i>,
which might, indeed, be called a creed of creeds in the literal
acceptation of the words.</p>

<p>But the imposture was too shallow to take with so clear-sighted
a people as the Jews unquestionably were: the
pretended Messiah was repudiated by them with disdain,
and the hostility of the Koreish against the son of Abdallah,
was, in some degree, fomented and fanned by the Jews of
Mecca. Hence the implacable and unrelenting hatred with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
which Mohammed pursued the unfortunate Israelites to the
last moment of his life. That he changed the kebla of
prayer from Jerusalem to Mecca, and that in his nocturnal
journey to Heaven, he beheld the divine tabernacle in a
straight line above the latter city, instead of Zion, where he
undoubtedly originally intended to behold it,&mdash;could, at the
most, provoke a smile of contempt and derision; but the
appalling cruelties which he indicted, both upon individuals
and upon entire tribes of the doomed nation, must fill the
mind of the impartial explorer of history with deep indignation
against the man who could <em>so</em> avenge his offended
vanity. His first exploit in this direction, was the expulsion
of the <span class="smcap">Kainoka</span> tribe from Medina, where they had hitherto
been permitted to dwell in peace, by the large toleration of
the <em>Idolators</em>. The prophet of Islam seized the occasion of
an accidental tumult, in which the Kainoka had taken part,
to place before them the alternative of embracing his religion,
or contending with him in battle. A <em>brave</em> challenge
this, to the unfortunate Jews, to do battle with him, and
which displayed in the fullest, though certainly not in the
most favorable light, the <em>magnanimous</em> disposition of the
son of Abdallah, that has been so highly extolled by
some historians. Still, even with the fearful odds of
number and martial spirit against them, the feeble and
unwarlike Israelites preferred the unequal contest to apostacy
from the faith of their fathers. It was decided in fifteen
days, of course with the total overthrow and capture of the
whole tribe; and, had it not been that the Charegites,
mindful of the friendship which once existed between them
and their humble allies, the Kainoka, warmly interceded on
behalf of the wretched captives, the prophet of God would
have slain every one of them. As it was, they were
despoiled of their homes and property; and driven forth, to
the number of seven hundred men, with their wives and
children, to seek a refuge on the confines of Syria, to which
quarter the blessings of the new creed had not yet extended.
The <span class="smcap">Nadhirites</span> were the next to feel the weight of his arm.
In their case, indeed, some provocation had been given, as
they had conspired to assassinate the prophet in a friendly
interview. Protected by the walls of their castle (situated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
about three miles from Medina), they fought with such
boldness and resolution, that Mohammed was fain to grant
them an honorable capitulation.</p>

<p>The war of the nations interrupted for a time Mohammed’s
operations against the Jews; but even on the day
that the confederated nations had abandoned the siege of
Medina, he marched against the tribe of <span class="smcap">Koraidha</span>. A
campaign of twenty-five days sufficed to compel their surrender
at discretion. They fondly believed that their old
allies of Medina would, by their intercession, preserve them
at least from the extreme measure of Mohammed’s wrath;&mdash;vain
hope: fanaticism had made rapid progress among
the Ansars. A venerable elder of the Charegite tribe, to
whose judgment they referred their case, pronounced the
penalty of death against them for their hostility to Islam.
To the number of seven hundred they were led in chains to
the market-place of Medina, where a grave had been dug to
receive them; into this they were forced to descend, and
the apostle of God indulged his vengeful mind with the
sight of their slaughter and burial.... Verily,
verily, the blackest and most atrocious of crimes are
committed in the name of God. A few years after the
extirpation of the Koraidha, Mohammed marched, at the
head of two hundred horse, and fourteen hundred foot,
against the ancient city of <span class="smcap">Chaibar</span>, the seat of the Jewish
power in Arabia. Chaibar was protected by eight strong
castles, which were successively reduced by the Moslems in
sixteen weeks, not, however, without considerable loss on
the part of the conquerors. After the fall of the castles, the
city was forced to surrender (628). The inhabitants had their
lives granted to them, and permission to dwell in the land,
on condition that they should pay to the prophet, an annual
tribute of the one-half of their revenue. But the chief of
Chaibar was subjected to the most cruel tortures, to force
from him a confession of his hidden treasures; and when the
100,000 pieces of gold, which had been concealed, were
delivered up at last, he and several of the most notable of
his people were mercilessly butchered in cold blood. It was
in this campaign against Chaibar that Mohammed bestowed
upon Ali, the surname of the “Lion of God,” gained by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the slaughter of 150 Hebrews, who are stated to have fallen
by the irresistible scymitar of Abu Taleb’s illustrious son.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The Jewess <span class="smcap">Asma</span> had offended the dignity of the prophet
by some satirical strictures on his private life; he bribed a
miserable blind Jew, named <span class="smcap">Omeir</span>, to assassinate her.
This wretched tool murdered the ill-fated woman in her
chamber, and nailed her body to the floor; having some
misgivings of conscience, he accosted the prophet next
morning while at prayer, and asked him whether God might
not, perhaps, punish the crime perpetrated? whereupon the
pious apostle bade him to be of good cheer, as the killing of
a Jew, even if not at all times a meritorious act, was, at
least, a matter of perfect indifference to the Ruler of the
Universe! In the same way he deputed assassins to slay
the learned Jew, <span class="smcap">Eshref</span>; in the name of God he sent
them on their bloody errand! The venerable <span class="smcap">Abu Aas</span> was
murdered in his sleep at his bidding: the poor old man had
reached his hundredth year, and might safely have been
permitted to die in peace, but considerations of the kind
weighed but little with the son of Abdallah; an insult to
his apostolic dignity could only be washed off in the blood
of the offender. But why sully our pages with the long list
of private and public murders perpetrated by the command,
or at the instigation of, this precious pretender to a divine
mission, ... sufficient has been stated to illustrate the
cruel and sanguinary disposition of the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Mohammed had left Mecca most reluctantly, and only
when flight alone could preserve his life from the swords of
his then all-powerful enemies. The thought to revisit as a
conqueror, the city and the holy temple of the Kaaba, was
ever present to his mind. When the Jews, by their disdainful
rejection of his advances, had turned his friendship
into implacable hatred, he changed the kebla of prayer from
Jerusalem to Mecca, clearly indicating thereby, that, whatever
might be the merits of Medina, the holy city of the
Kaaba stood still foremost in his affections. As soon as
he had firmly established his empire over Medina, and some
powerful tribes of the desert, and had destroyed or expelled
the Jewish tribes of the Kainoka, the Nadhirites, and the
Koraidha,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he projected a scheme for the conquest of Mecca,
(towards the end of 627). Conscious that his power was
not yet sufficiently great to prevail by force of arms, he
craftily disguised his expedition against the city of his birth,
in the form of a peaceful and pious pilgrimage. Seventy
camels, chosen and bedecked for sacrifice, preceded the van
of his host of 1400 picked men. The captives who fell into
his hands, in his advance to the territory of the sacred city,
were dismissed without ransom, to carry to the Koreish the
solemn assurance of his peaceful intentions. All that the
good man wanted, was to be permitted to enter the city,
with his 1400 armed followers, to sacrifice the camels which
he had brought with him for the purpose, and to perform
the customary seven circumambulations round the Kaaba.
Of course, had the Koreish conceded these points, the rest
would have been a task of easy accomplishment. But the
Koreish had had opportunities sufficient to know the crafty
tongue and the false heart of the son of Abdallah. They
encountered him, therefore, in the plain, within a day’s
journey of the city, with such numbers and with such resolution,
that he was fain to abandon his purpose for the time,
and even to consent to the conclusion of a ten years’ truce,
with the Koreish and their allies. In the treaty drawn up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
to that effect,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> he, the infallible prophet of God, the favored
mortal raised by the Divine will to an equality with the
cherubim and seraphim in the heavenly hierarchy, the
trusted leader who had solemnly promised his believing
followers, a triumphal entry into the stronghold of the most
formidable and most dreaded of the enemies of Islam,&mdash;was
obliged even to waive the title of Apostle of God, and to figure
as plain Mohammed Abul Kasem. Still the Koreish granted
him, for the ensuing year, the privilege of entering the city
unarmed and as a friend, and of remaining three days to
accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage&mdash;a fatal mistake on
their part, and which they might have foreseen one so crafty
as Mohammed would turn to excellent account. For the
time being, however, the authority of the pretended prophet
of God was considerably shaken, and some of the newly
converted Bedoween tribes showed symptoms of disaffection.
The successful campaign against Chaibar revived the faith
and courage of his followers, and restored the wavering
loyalty of the wandering tribes.</p>

<p>After the conquest of Chaibar, Mohammed sent six embassies
with letters to the neighbouring princes, calling
upon them to embrace the religion of Islam: the seal of the
letter bore the inscription, “Mohammed, the Apostle of
God.” The Greek emperor, <span class="smcap">Heraclius</span>, returning in
triumph from the Persian war, received and entertained one
of these ambassadors with great urbanity at Emesa. <span class="smcap">Kobad
II.</span>, of Persia (<span class="smcap">Siroes</span>)<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> tore the letter, and dismissed the
envoy with ignominy. <span class="smcap">Mokawkas</span>, the Byzantine governor
of Memphis, a born Egyptian, and a Jacobite or Monophysite<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
in religion; and who, in the disorder of the Persian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
war, had aspired to independence, and thereby exposed
himself to the resentment of Heraclius, declined, indeed,
the proposal of a new religion, but accompanied his refusal
with flattering compliments and with gifts; among other,
two Coptic damsels, one of whom, Mary, became the favorite
concubine of the prophet, to whom she bore a son, Ibrahim,
who died, however, at the tender age of fifteen months. The
King of Abyssinia also returned a polite answer. But
<span class="smcap">Haris</span>, governor of Damascus, threatened war upon the
presumptuous Arabian; and <span class="smcap">Amru</span>, prince of Gassan, a
vassal of the Byzantine emperor, put the envoy to death,
for which outrage Mohammed sent afterwards an army into
Syria, with what results we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>According to the stipulations of the treaty of Hodaibeh,
Mohammed was permitted to perform, towards the end of
628, at the head of a body of pious pilgrims, his three days’
devotion in the Kaaba; the Koreish retiring, meanwhile, to
the hills. After the customary sacrifice, he evacuated the
city on the fourth day; but in this short space of time, he
had succeeded in sowing the seeds of division between the
hostile chiefs, and to gain over to his cause <span class="smcap">Kaled</span> and
<span class="smcap">Amrou</span>, or <span class="smcap">Amru</span>, the future conquerors of Syria and Egypt.
The interdiction of wine, and of dice and lotteries, falls in
this period.</p>

<p>It was after the return from this pilgrimage, that he sent
an army of 3000 Moslems against Amru, prince of Gassan,
and the Greeks. The army was led by <span class="smcap">Zeid</span>, Mohammed’s
freedman and one of his earliest disciples. At Muta, three
days’ journey from Jerusalem, they met the Gassanides and
the Greeks: a fierce and bloody battle ensued; Zeid fell
fighting in the foremost ranks; the holy banner, which
escaped from his relaxing grasp, was seized by <span class="smcap">Jaafar</span>, the
leader appointed by Mohammed to succeed Zeid, in the
event of the decease of the latter. Jaafar’s right hand was
severed from his body by the sword of a Roman soldier; he
shifted the standard to the left hand: this met the same fate;
he embraced the holy banner with the bleeding stumps, and
thus upheld it, till the tide of life ebbed away from fifty
wounds. The vacant place was as worthily filled by
<span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>, the second successor appointed by the prophet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
in case of accident. He also fell, transfixed by the lance of
a Roman. The battle was lost, the flower of the Moslem
host annihilated, and the ambitions dreams of empire were
dispelled at the very time when they seemed to promise fairest,&mdash;had
not <span class="smcap">Kaled</span>, the recent convert of Mecca, at this
critical juncture, rescued the falling standard, and assumed
the command, with the same bravery as his predecessors, but
with still greater prowess, and with greater success. Nine
swords were broken in his hand; and every enemy that
dared to approach him, was made to bite the dust by his
invincible arm. Night put an end to the contest: in the
nocturnal council of the camp, Kaled was chosen, or rather
confirmed, leader of the gallant band of warriors, who had
survived the carnage of the day. Death had been fearfully
busy in the ranks of the Moslems; and the Greeks, though
awed by the valor of Kaled, had still an immense superiority
of number in their favor. Kaled wisely resolved, therefore,
to save the wreck of his forces by a skilful retreat. His
admirable combinations, and the dread inspired by his
prowess, rescued the host of the faithful believers of Islam
from all but certain destruction; and the well-earned gratitude
of the prophet bestowed upon the hero of Muta, the
glorious appellation of the “Sword of God,” a name destined
after to ring many a time and oft as the knell of doom in
the ears of the affrighted Christians.</p>

<p>Mohammed had never ceased to meditate the conquest of
Mecca, and his power was now, indeed, sufficiently great
and solid to promise an easy accomplishment of this, the
darling object of his ambition; but the ten years’ truce
seemed an obstacle which it would not be easy to surmount.
Notwithstanding, however, he silently prepared the means
to carry his plans against the city of his birth into execution,
should a favorable opportunity offer. The reverse
which his forces had suffered at Muta, impelled the Koreish
to furnish him with the desired pretext; they attacked one
of the tribes confederated with Mohammed. Ten thousand
soldiers were speedily gathered round the banner of the
prophet, and led by him against the offending city. A rapid
and secret march brought them almost within sight of Mecca,
before the Koreish had the least notion of their approach.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Unprepared as they were, it would have been sheer madness
to contend against the overwhelming forces which now
encompassed the city of the Kaaba: they resolved therefore to
throw themselves upon the clemency of their triumphant exile.
On the 11th of January, 630, the haughty chief of the house
of Ommiyah presented the keys of the city; and confessed,
under the scymitar of Omar, that the son of Abdallah was
the apostle of the true God. The patriotic attachment which
Mohammed unquestionably bore the city of his birth, and
political considerations of a high order, stayed the avenging
hand of the victorious outcast. Kaled had, indeed, slain
twenty-eight of the inhabitants, ere the potent command of
the prophet to spare the vanquished, could restrain his ruthless
arm; but Mohammed blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant,
and, though he proscribed eleven men and six women,
few only were put to death by him. Among these was
<span class="smcap">Abdolusa</span>, who, after having embraced the faith of Islam,
had relapsed into idolatry. <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>, once the secretary
of Mohammed, and who had been employed by him to
note down the fragmentary revelations imparted by Gabriel,
had a narrow escape. The clear-sighted man had seen through
the shallow imposture palmed upon the people by the pretended
apostle; and he had imprudently boasted, that he
also might claim the name and rank of a prophet, considering
that he had it in his power to change, or to suppress,
the holy revelations dictated to him by Mohammed. To
escape the vengeance of his offended master, he had fled to
Mecca, where he had, however, still continued to provoke
his resentment by exposing and ridiculing his ignorance.
When Mecca was taken, Abdallah fell prostrate at the feet
of Mohammed, and implored his pardon. Othman, Abdallah’s
foster-brother, entreated the prophet to spare the life of the
humble penitent, a request which was at last most reluctantly
<ins class="corr" id="tn-39" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'granted, Mahommed'">
granted, Mohammed</ins> declaring that he had so long hesitated,
to allow time for some zealous disciple to strike the kneeling
apostate dead at his feet.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The poet, <span class="smcap">Huires</span>, paid the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
penalty of his satires on the Apostle of God: but <span class="smcap">Soheir</span>
more wisely purchased, not only forgiveness, but a rich
reward in the bargain, by one of the grossest and most
extravagant pieces of adulation that ever proceeded even
from an Oriental pen.</p>

<p>The Koreish and the other inhabitants of Mecca, professed
the religion of Islam, and acknowledged the temporal and
spiritual supremacy of the prophet. The 360 idols of the
Kaaba were ignominiously broken; Mohammed assisting
with his own hands, in the work of destruction, nay, even
lending his august shoulders for Ali to mount upon, to
accomplish the overthrow of some idols placed a little above
ordinary reach. This meritorious feat was performed on a
Friday; which day was, therefore, henceforward appointed
by the prophet as the holy day of Islam.</p>

<p>But it was by no means the intention of Mohammed to
despoil the city of his birth, of the lucrative trade in religion
to which it had hitherto been mainly indebted for its pre-eminence
among the cities of Arabia. The people of Mecca
were agreeably disappointed, when they beheld the Prophet
of God solemnly consecrating again the purified Kaaba, and
performing the customary circumambulations and sacrifices
as of old. They were readily reconciled to the belief in a
sole Deity, since their astute townsman assigned a local
habitation on earth to the idea of the God whom he
commanded them and the nations of the world to worship,
and placed this habitation within the walls of their own city.
Even the black stone was not forgotten by the crafty politician:
his reverential touch cleansed it from the pollution of
ages of idolatry, and restored it to the pristine purity and
holiness of Gabriel’s celestial gift to Abraham; and to crown
all, he still heightened the sanctity of the holy city, by
enacting a perpetual law that no unbeliever should ever
dare to set his foot within its sacred precincts.</p>

<p>The conquest of Mecca secured Mohammed the allegiance
of many of the Bedoween tribes, who, troubling themselves
but little about religious opinions and controversies, readily
gave their adhesion to the cause which the gods seemed to
prosper. But some of the most important tribes of Hejaz,
and more especially the people of Tayef, persisted in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
idolatry, and a great confederacy was formed among them to
break the power of Mohammed. The prophet resolved to meet
the threatening danger; he collected a host of 12,000 men,
well-armed and well-appointed; the confederates had not one-half
the number to oppose him. But the skilful tactics of
the pagans, and the overweening confidence of the Mussulmans,
brought the apostle and his new faith to the verge of
ruin. Having incautiously descended into the valley of
<span class="smcap">Honain</span>, the Moslems were suddenly attacked on all sides
by the archers and slingers of the enemy, who occupied
the heights; the ranks of the faithful were thrown into
confusion by the unexpected and fierce onset of the foe; and
the stoutest hearts among them quailed, when they saw
themselves caught as in a net. The Koreish secretly rejoiced
at the impending destruction of their conquerors, and even
prepared to go over to the enemy. All seemed lost;&mdash;despairing
of victory, the prophet, seeking a glorious death, urged
his white mule against the wall of spears that encompassed
him: his faithful followers dragged him back, and covered
him with their persons from the thrusts and darts aimed at
his breast. Three of these devoted followers fell dead at
his feet;&mdash;but the moment of weak despair was past, and
soon the thunder of his voice was heard again, reanimating
the sinking courage of the Moslems, and striking terror into
the hearts of the idolators. The Koreish forgot their treacherous
intentions; the flying Mussulmans returned from all
sides to the holy standard; and the attacks of the enemy
were now everywhere vigorously repulsed. Defeat was
changed into victory, and a merciless slaughter of the
conquered and flying pagans, avenged the temporary disgrace
of the followers of Islam. From the field of Honain,
Mohammed marched without delay to Tayef, the centre and
stronghold of the confederacy. He laid siege to that fortress;
but the desperate valor of the inhabitants defeated all his
efforts to effect its reduction; and after twenty days spent
before it, he deemed it the wisest course to rest satisfied
for the time with the victory of Honain, and not to court
the chances of an inglorious defeat. He, therefore, raised
the siege, and marched back to Mecca. In his operations
against Tayef, he gave an instance of how cheap he held his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
own laws and precepts, where they happened to clash with
his interests: he ordered the extirpation of all the fruit trees
in the fertile lands round the city.</p>

<p>In the division of the rich spoils of the expedition of
Honain, he acted with consummate skill. Instead of
excluding the Koreish from their share, to punish them for
their ambiguous conduct during the campaign, he bestowed
double measure upon them; the most disaffected of them all,
Abu Sophian, being presented with no less than three hundred
camels and twenty ounces of silver: no wonder, then,
that that rapacious chief and his followers should have,
henceforth, become sincere adherents to so profitable a
creed. The old companions in arms of the prophet were
reconciled to this manifest injustice in the distribution of
the spoil, by artful flatteries and promises of heavenly
rewards: his own share of the plunder (one-fifth) he assigned
to the soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Although he had failed to reduce Tayef, yet by the extirpation
of the fruit trees he had struck a severe blow against
the people of that city; the fortifications had been considerably
injured by the battering rams and the mining operations,
so that there was ample reason to dread the event of a
renewal of the siege. The people of Tayef resolved, therefore,
to sue for peace; their deputies endeavoured to obtain
favorable conditions, and, at least, the toleration of their
ancient worship, though even only for a short period.
Mohammed would not concede them even one day; at last
they simply entreated to be excused from the obligation of
prayer to the God of Islam; in vain: Mohammed was inexorable,
and Tayef at length submitted to the harsh conditions
imposed by the prophet. The idols were broken, their
temples demolished, and all the tribes of Hejaz acknowledged
the supreme rule of the son of Abdallah. The ruler of
<span class="smcap">Bahrein</span>, the King of <span class="smcap">Oman</span>, and the King of the <span class="smcap">Beni
Gassan</span>, in Syria, confessed the God of Mohammed, and
submitted to the sway of the prophet. Yemen also, and
the rest of the peninsula, was reduced to obedience by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
victorious lieutenants, and the ambassadors who knelt before
the throne of Medina, (631, hence called the year of the
embassies), were, in the words of the Arabian proverb, “as
numerous as the dates that fall from the palm-tree in the
season of ripeness.”</p>

<p>Absolute master of the whole of Arabia, the son of
Abdallah resolved to subject Syria also to his sway; he
solemnly declared war against the Empire of the East, and
summoned the faithful to the holy standard. But the prospect
of the difficulties and hardships of a march through the
desert, during the intolerable heat of the summer, and, perhaps
also, the recollection of Muta, discouraged the Moslems;
and the most urgent solicitations of the apostle were disregarded,
or met by more or less cogent excuses. Still the
great champions of the faith, Ali, Omar, Othman, Kaled,
Amru, Abu Bekr, Abu Obeidah, Abbas,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and many others,
attended by trains of devoted followers, gathered round the
prophet, and enabled him thus to take the field, at the head
of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> After
one of the most distressing marches through the desert, the
Moslem host was compelled to halt midway near <span class="smcap">Tabuc</span>,
ten days’ journey from Medina and Damascus. The hardships
endured had considerably cooled the ardor of the
faithful, and wisely declining to engage the disciplined forces
of the Eastern empire with his wearied and dispirited
followers, Mohammed contented himself with inviting the
Greek Emperor once more to embrace his religion, and
retired to Arabia; leaving a body of picked men, under the
command of the intrepid Kaled, to prosecute the war.
The valor and activity of that leader secured the submission
of the tribes and cities from the Euphrates to Ailah, at the
head of the Red Sea. Mohammed returned to Medina,
where he pronounced a sentence of excommunication for
fifty days against those who had been the most disobedient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
to his call. He then prepared for a great pilgrimage to
Mecca, which he accomplished in the early part of 632,
attended by 60,000 Moslems.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In this, his last visit to the
city of his birth, he gave a great number of laws and precepts;
and, among others, the interdiction of the private
revenge of murder and other injuries.</p>

<p>It has already been stated, that Mohammed’s health
had been declining ever since the campaign of Chaibar,
(see <a href="#Footnote_30">page 34, note</a>); yet such was the strength and
vigor of his constitution, that up to the time of his last
and fatal illness, he remained equal to the physical and
mental fatigues of his mission. However, soon after his
return from the last pilgrimage to Mecca, he fell ill of an
inflammatory fever, with occasional fits of delirium, which
he endeavoured to combat by frequent affusions with cold
water. When he became conscious of the fatal nature of
his illness, he laid himself out to die, as an accomplished
actor, like Octavianus Augustus. Leaning on his cousin
and son-in-law, Ali,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and on his uncle, Abbas, or the son of
the latter, Fadl, he dragged himself to the mosque to perform
the functions of public prayer: from the pulpit he called upon
his subjects freely and boldly to state any grievance that any
one of them might have suffered at his hands, and to prefer
any just claims against his estate. A safe challenge indeed:
the victims of his lust of power and revenge were laid in
their graves, and could not appear against him <em>there</em>; nor
could <em>they</em> prefer any claim against his estate, who had
been despoiled by him or his lieutenants, in their predatory
expeditions. No wonder then that the immaculate justice
and piety of the Apostle of God, were fully attested by the
silence of the congregation in presence of this challenge,&mdash;excepting
a paltry claim of three drachms of silver, which was,
of course, at once duly settled by Mohammed, with a profusion
of thanks into the bargain, that the “creditor” had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
rather demanded payment in this world, than waited to
accuse him at the judgment-seat of God!</p>

<p>Up to the third day before his death, he continued to
perform the function of public prayer; on that day his
strength failed him, and he deputed Abu Bekr in his place,
which was afterwards skilfully laid hold of by the latter and
Ayesha, to found a claim to the successorship in the sacerdotal
and regal office, in favor of Abu Bekr, to the prejudice
of Ali.</p>

<p>He then made his last dispositions, enfranchised his
slaves, (seventeen men and eleven women), had alms distributed
to the poor of Medina, and minutely directed the
order of his funeral. He expressed a desire to dictate to
his secretary a new divine book, the sum and accomplishment
of all his revelations, and which, according to
Mohammed’s convenient maxim, would have superseded
the authority of the Koran, in all points in which its teachings
might happen to clash with the rules and precepts laid
down in the latter. As Mohammed had preached an eternal
and immutable God, and had declared the substance of the
Koran to be uncreated and eternal, the gross absurdity of
attempting a new, revised, and amended edition of it, could
not fail to strike the more rational among his disciples.
They, with Omar at their head, firmly refused, therefore, to
consent to the prophet’s anxiously expressed wish&mdash;a curious
comment on the sincerity of their professed conviction of
his divine mission, and his communings with the messenger
of heaven, and for which, their <em>assumed</em> belief that his
mental faculties were, at the time, impaired by the effects
of illness, afforded but an indifferent apology. Be this
however as it may, the point was vehemently discussed
between them and the more devout followers of the prophet;
and the dispute, which was carried on in the chamber of the
dying man, rose at last to such a pitch, that Mohammed
reluctantly desisting from his desire, was forced to
reprove the indecent vehemence of the disputants on
either side.</p>

<p>Even to the last moment of his life, Mohammed consistently
carried out his system of deception. He told his
friends about him, that he had received a last visit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Gabriel, who had now bidden an everlasting farewell to the
earth. In a familiar discourse, he had once boasted of the
peculiar and exclusive prerogative granted to him, that the
angel of death should respectfully solicit his permission
before he was to be allowed to take his soul. When he felt
the near approach of his dissolution, he calmly informed the
Moslem chiefs assembled round him, that the Great
Destroyer had just preferred his request, and that he,
Mohammed, had granted the permission asked! Stretched
on a carpet spread upon the floor, and with his head reclining
on the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of his wives, he
expired on the 7th day of June, 632.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> His last words were:
“O God!... pardon my sins.... Yes, ... I
come, ... among my fellow-citizens on high.”</p>

<p>His death dismayed his followers; the more fanatical
among them could not bring themselves to believe in the
actual departure of his spirit from this world. The idea of
a trance, or of a resurrection after a few days’ apparent
death, found ready credence with them. Omar, unsheathing
his scymitar, threatened to strike off the heads of the
infidels who should dare to affirm that the prophet was
no more!&mdash;a curious comment upon his refusal to allow
the dying prophet to re-write the Koran. At last, Abu
Bekr succeeded in making them listen to reason: “Is it
Mohammed,” he said, “or Mohammed’s God whom you
worship? Has not the apostle himself predicted that he
should experience the common fate of mortality?” This
calm and rational address had the desired effect; the death
of the prophet was admitted by all, and his body was
piously interred by the hands of Ali, on the same spot on
which he expired, and which is now surrounded by the great
mosque of Medina. The story of the hanging coffin at Mecca
is a vulgar and puerile invention, not worth the trouble of
refutation.</p>

<p>I have been led by the superior importance and interest
which attach to the subject, to extend this chapter, perhaps,
considerably beyond the limits compatible with the nature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
and size of the present work; still I cannot abstain from
adding a short sketch of Mohammed’s habits of life, and a
few brief remarks on the Koran.</p>

<p>In his domestic life and intercourse, Mohammed was most
simple and unassuming. The ruler of Arabia fed usually
upon barley bread and dates; water was his ordinary
drink, though he delighted, and occasionally indulged, in
the taste of milk and honey; he never drank wine. The
powerful chieftain who could command the services of
thousands, did not disdain performing the menial offices of
the household: he kindled the fire, swept the floor, milked
the ewes, and mended with his own hands, his shoes and his
woollen garment (the use of silk he rejected as too effeminate);
nor was it an uncommon circumstance to see the
Apostle of God barefoot. He slept on the bare ground, or
on a carpet or straw mat spread upon the floor. He always
performed, with the most rigorous strictness, the prayers
and ablutions enjoined by the Koran. With the regal and
sacerdotal office, he had assumed the reserve and austerity
that befitted his high position; yet he would occasionally
unbend in the circle of his friends, when he enchanted all
around him by the graceful, though dignified, affability of
his manners, and the charms of his conversation. He was
passionately fond of fairy tales. He delighted in perfumes
and cats, which latter partiality he shared with one of his
cotemporaries, the learned Abu Horaira, who gained for
himself the surname of “the father of a cat.” His hair,
beard, and eyebrows, were the objects of his most anxious
care and solicitude; he dyed them with considerable skill,
a glossy light-chesnut color.</p>

<p>He was most passionately addicted to the fair sex: in the
indulgence of his amorous desires, he set his own laws at
nought. The Arabians had enjoyed, from time immemorial,
an unbounded licence of polygamy; the Koran limited the
number of legitimate wives or concubines to <em>four</em>, the
prophet had <em>seventeen</em> wives; but then, Gabriel had descended
with a special revelation, dispensing the favored
apostle from the laws which he had imposed on the nation.
<span class="smcap">Zeineb</span>, the beautiful wife of <span class="smcap">Zeid</span>, his freedman and adopted
son, excited his desire. The grateful husband consented to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
a divorce, and the prophet added her to the number of his
wives; but as the filial relation in which the young woman
stood to Mohammed, even though only by adoption, was
likely to produce some scandal, and to raise some scruples
in the minds of the faithful, the complaisant Gabriel
descended with another verse of the Koran, appropriate to
the occasion. Again, in the case of Mary, the Egyptian
slave, the indefatigable angel was at hand to oblige the
Apostle of God. Had Mohammed liked wine, there can be
no doubt, but that Gabriel would have been ready with
another verse of the Koran, to dispense the prophet from
the restriction imposed upon all other mortals. A better
proof than the nature of these successive “revelations,” so
entirely subservient to the gratification of his passions,
could not well be adduced, to show that Mohammed was
not, as some good-natured historians would fain believe him
to have been, the enthusiastic dupe of his own illusions, but
simply a cool and calculating politician, who made the institution
of a new religious system the basis and engine of his
power and dominion; most probably, sincerely believing
also, that he was really conferring an immense boon upon
his people. His vengeful and sanguinary disposition, has
been already fully exposed in the narration of his life. The
impartiality of history relieves those darker touches in the
picture of Mohammed’s character, by a trait of unaffected
humanity. His decree that, in the sale of captives, mothers
should never be separated from their children, may well, as
Gibbon says, moderate the censure of the historian. How
the thousands of hapless negro mothers that have had their
children ruthlessly torn from their arms in <em>Christian</em>
America, would bless the memory of the Arabian legislator,
could that humane decree of his find force and application
in the Western Hemisphere!</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Koran</span> is the sacred book of Islam; the successive
“revelations” imparted to Mohammed, were diligently
recorded by his disciples on palm-leaves, skins, and the
shoulder-bones of mutton; and the fragments, or “pages,”
were thrown into a domestic chest, in the custody of one of
Mohammed’s wives. In 634, these fragments were collected
and published by Abu Bekr; the sacred volume was revised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
by the Khalif Othman, in 651. It consists of 114 chapters
(<span class="smcap">Surats</span>, <em>i.e.</em> stages or degrees), of very unequal lengths,
and jumbled together without chronological order, or
systematic arrangement. The chapters are made up of
plagiarisms from the Bible, rabbinical and apocryphal
legends, religious and moral precepts, descriptions of the
joys of paradise and the torments of hell, declamations and
rhapsodies. The style is, for the most part, inflated, rarely
poetical, never sublime; yet Mohammed had the cool
audacity to rest the truth of his mission on the incomparable
merit of the Koran, as an intellectual, linguistic, and poetical
performance. He blasphemously asserted, that God alone
could have penned, or dictated, its divine contents; as no
human, nor even an angelic intelligence, could possibly have
conceived anything like them!!!</p>

<p>The dogmatic part of the Koran (the <span class="smcap">Iman</span>), comprises
the two articles of faith, viz., the belief in one God, and in
his prophet Mohammed; and the four practical duties of
Islam, viz., prayer, ablutions, fasting, and alms-giving: these
duties are reduced to the level of mere mechanical performances,
without one atom of spontaneity about them, and are
looked upon by most Mohammedans as irksome tasks, which
must be accomplished, however, to secure the reward of
paradise; the formal permission granted to supply with sand
the scarcity of water, so that the prescribed lustration of the
hands, the face, and the body may be practised even in the
arid desert, shows how little capable the legislator must have
been to conceive and comprehend the true spirit and intention
of his own ordinances. The Koran pronounces&mdash;of
course: is there a religion that does not?&mdash;sentence of eternal
damnation against all unbelievers; it imagines a gradation
of seven inconveniently hot places, of which the highest and
least uncomfortable is, of course, appropriated for the exclusive
use of Mohammedans who have been lacking in piety
during their mortal career; according to the less or greater
gravity of their respective offences, they are condemned to
remain denizens of this the mildest of the seven hells, for
periods varying from 900 to 9000 years, after which they are
admitted to the joys of paradise. The place immediately
beneath this purgatorial hell is assigned to the Christians;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the hell next to this is allotted to the Jews, whom the
prophet of Islam would indeed gladly have sent down lower,
had he dared to treat monotheists worse than idolators; the
Sabians inhabit the fourth, the Magians the fifth, the gross
idolators the sixth hell; the deepest and hottest hell is destined
to receive hypocrites in religion, and may therefore
safely be assumed to be of larger dimensions and infinitely
greater capacity than the other six together. The paradise
of the Koran abounds in groves, fountains, and rivers; the
blessed Moslems who are permitted to enter its gates will
dwell in palaces of marble, eat artificial dainties and luscious
fruits presented in dishes of gold, drink rich wines,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> dress in
robes of silk, adorned with pearls and diamonds, and have a
numerous retinue of attendants; and above all, each Moslem
will enjoy the society and possession of seventy-two Houris,
or black-eyed girls, of resplendent beauty, blooming youth,
virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility&mdash;rather a pleasant
picture for a sensual people like the Arabians. To the
female sex also the gates of paradise are open; but the privileges
and enjoyments which may await the ladies of the
Mohammedan faith, are not specified in the Koran. Still,
we must not be unjust: above the vulgar joys and sensual
pleasures borrowed from this world, Mohammed places the
delights of familiar conversation with the sages, and he
expressly declares that all meaner happiness will be forgotten
and despised by the saints and martyrs who shall be permitted
to behold the face of God.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s assertion that the Koran was the production
of the highest intelligence, and comprised within it the
knowledge of all times, has, ever since the establishment of
his creed, proved a bar to the intellectual culture and
progress of his people and of the other nations who were
induced or compelled to adopt his faith; his interdiction to
reproduce the human face and form on canvas or in marble,
or any other material, and which with singular poverty of
invention he had devised as the only possible check to idolatry,
has had the natural effect to suppress and extinguish in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the Moslem nations the love of the fine arts. True, when
conquest had placed the wealth of empires at the disposal
of the sons of the Desert, many of Mohammed’s followers
could not resist the natural longing after the treasures and
enjoyments of science, art, and literature; and indeed
the republic of letters is vastly indebted to many of them
for their labors and researches in various fields of human
lore, more especially in geography, history, philosophy,
medicine, natural philosophy, chemistry, mathematics, and
above all, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and astronomy.
But then, as <span class="smcap">A. W. von Schlegel</span>, says, “All this was done,
as it were, behind the back of the prophet, and the votaries
of art, science, and literature, among the Arabians must,
from a Koranic point of view, be regarded in the light of
free-thinkers.”</p>

<p>The ritual of the faith of Islam, and the interdictions
decreed by the prophet, have been already incidentally
touched upon in various parts of this chapter; we have
therefore simply to add here that the Koran commands
every faithful Moslem to visit, at feast once in his life, the
holy city of Mecca, and the Kaaba.</p>

<p>One great redeeming feature of the religion of Islam was
that it was originally destitute of a priesthood, and repudiated
monachism; the <em>Ulemas</em> were simply intended to
be the expounders and interpreters of the law.</p>

<p>On Friday, the appointed day of public worship, when the
faithful are assembled in the mosque, any respectable elder
may ascend the pulpit to begin the prayer and pronounce
the sermon: there is no need of a duly appointed priest.
But, unfortunately, the Ulemas and Imams of the present
day act very much in the capacity of an actual clergy: and
there is indeed no great difference between fakirs and
dervishes and Roman Catholic monks.</p>

<p>The Koran contains also the civil and criminal code of the
Mussulmans; the punishments decreed in it for injuries,
offences, and crimes are mostly based upon the principle of
retaliation.</p>

<p>Briefly to sum up: though it must be admitted that the
religion of Islam, calmly and dispassionately examined by
the light of reason, contains, by the side of the grossest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
absurdities, the most palpable falsehoods, and the veriest
rubbish, much also that is true and of sterling worth; and
that it has exercised a certain civilising influence over the
barbarous nations to whom it was first preached, yet few
only will venture to deny that it lacks altogether the
higher and most essential qualities of a universal faith.
Even the basis whereon it rests, the great eternal truth of a
sole Deity, is tarnished and clouded in it by the companionship
which it is forced to bear to a miserable fiction placed
by the side of it, and with equal attributes. There are
some few, strange though it may appear, who almost regret
that the victorious career of the Moslems should have been
checked by <span class="smcap">Leo the Isaurian</span> and by <span class="smcap">Charles Martel</span>.
What would have become of Europe&mdash;what of civilisation,
had the Moslems conquered? Let the admirers of Islam
look at the state of the Mussulman nations of the present
day: the fruit shows the quality of the tree. It is also a
favorite argument with historians and others, to point to
the <em>numbers</em> of believers in Islam, and to the twelve
centuries that the Mohammedan faith has endured, as
convincing proofs of the <em>truth</em> of that creed, or, at all events,
of a preponderating amount of truth in it. If arguments of
this kind are to apply, the Mormon faith also may claim
admission among the “received” creeds; and the names of
Joe Smith and Brigham Young may be expected, in the
course of fifty years or so, to figure among the “prophets
and apostles of religion.”</p>

death of the great Macedonian, and upon the feuds and struggles for
empire among his generals, was taken advantage of by the princes in
the north of Arabia, to extend their dominion beyond the frontier of
the peninsula. From the earliest times the wandering tribes had been in
the habit, more particularly during the scarcity of winter, to extort the
dangerous license of encamping on the skirts of Mesopotamia, Syria,
and Egypt, and had often extended their incursions to the very heart
of Chaldæa, or Babylonia (Irak). They now took formal possession of
a part of the latter country (hence called to the present day <span class="smcap">Irak-Arabi</span>),
and established in it a new Arabian state, the kingdom of
<span class="smcap">Hira</span>. Tribes from Yemen emigrated to the territory of Syria, and
established the state of <span class="smcap">Gassan</span>, in the country north of Damascus.

The new proselyte carried on a most vigorous persecution of the
Christians in his dominions, and more particularly in the city of
Negra, or Nag’ran, (situated between Saana and Mecca). The Christian
king of Abyssinia, who preferred an hereditary claim to the crown of
Yemen, as a descendant of <span class="smcap">Balkis</span>, Queen of Sheba, came to the rescue
of his oppressed fellow-believers, and speedily deprived the Jewish proselyte
of crown and life. He allied himself also with the Emperor
Justinian for the overthrow of the Persian power; but he failed in his
subsequent enterprise, and found himself incapable even of defending
his Arabian conquests, which were wrested from him by the revolt
and usurpation of <span class="smcap">Abrahah</span>, once the slave of a Roman merchant of
Adulis. The payment of a slight tribute alone acknowledged the
supremacy of the Ethiopian prince. After a long and prosperous
reign, the power of Abrahah was overthrown before the gates of Mecca,

Abyssinian Negus. The valor of the Koreishites, or perhaps the want
of provisions, compelled the investing host to a disgraceful retreat, and
broke the power of the Abyssinians so effectually that the kingdom of
Yemen became soon after an easy prey to the victorious arms of the
great Chosroes of Persia. Had the <em>Christian</em> Abrahah prevailed, the early

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> This Syrian city has been most strangely confounded by many
historians with Bassora, or Basra, on the Shat-el-Arab, in Irak-Arabi.
The latter city was only founded in 636, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, by the Khalif Omar,
which makes the mistake the more glaring and inexplicable.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">[19]</a> Some historians make Mohammed at the age of fourteen fight in
defence of the Kaaba, which a hostile tribe threatened to snatch from
the custody of the Koreish. They relate, also, how, at a later period
of his life, when the Kaaba, having been tumbled down by a formidable
torrent of rain, was rebuilding, the honor of fixing the sacred black
stone in the wall devolved upon him; and they endeavour to trace a
kind of causal connection between these incidents in the earlier life of
Mohammed and the religious bias of his later years. But the <em>facts</em>
relied upon here partake too much of the nature of <em>fiction</em>, to make
these speculative notions of much moment. Before his marriage with
Cadijah, Mohammed was in a humble and dependent position; and
from the time of his marriage up to when he took upon himself the
apostolic office, he was simply a wealthy but obscure citizen.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">[20]</a> Here, again, historians have sent Mohammed on a great many
journeys through Syria, Irak-Arabi, and to the adjoining provinces of
Persia and the Eastern Empire. They make him visit the courts, the
camps, and the temples of the East, and hold converse with princes,
bishops, and priests, more particularly with the Christian monks
Bahira, Sergius, and Nestor. An attentive study of the historic sources
at our command, and a careful examination of the life and writings of
Mohammed, tend to negative altogether the truth of these pretended
journeys and visits, which look very much like fictions got up by
imaginative historians to supply some plausible explanation of the
origin of Mohammed’s pretended mission&mdash;an explanation which may
be found much nearer home, as I shall endeavour to show in the text.
Here I will simply add that Mohammed, with all his talent, genius,
and eloquence, was, like the immense majority of his fellow-citizens,
an illiterate barbarian, who had not even been taught to read and write,
and was totally unacquainted with any but his native tongue, and
not likely, therefore, to profit much from converse with other nations.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> The assertion that Mohammed was subject to epileptic fits is a
base invention of the Greeks, who would seem to <em>impute</em> that morbid
affection to the apostle of a novel creed as a stain upon his moral
character deserving the reprobation and abhorrence of the Christian
world. Surely, these malignant bigots might have reflected that if
Mohammed had really been afflicted with that dread disorder, Christian
charity ought to have commanded them to pity his misfortune, rather
than rejoice over it or pretend to regard it in the light of a sign of
Divine wrath.</p>

also the cutting down of fruit-trees, more especially of palms. “Revere
your aunt, the palm-tree,” says the Koran, “for it is made of the
remainder of the clay of which Adam was formed.” Here in Chaibar,
a Jewish female, named Zainab, avenged the cruelties inflicted by
Mohammed upon her nation, by administering a slow poison to the
pretended apostle, whose prophetic knowledge was in this instance
lamentably at fault. To the effects of this poison he himself attributed
the gradual decline of his health from this time, and his increasing
infirmities; and both Abulfeda and Al Jannabi, zealous votaries of Islam
though they are, frankly admit the humiliating fact. The hatred which
he bore to the Jews, did not, however, prevent his adding to the number

<p class="pfs70">THE KHALIFS<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> FROM ABU BEKR TO HASHEM (OR HESHAM).</p>


<p>After the death of the prophet, his companions convened
an assembly to deliberate on the choice of his successor, as
Mohammed had abstained from expressing any explicit
command or wish in this respect. Several competitors
presented themselves, of whom Ali, Abu Bekr, and Omar
were the most important. The illustrious son of Abu
Taleb seemed indeed to combine in his own person every
possible claim to the vacant throne of Arabia; he was
chief, in his own right, of the family of Hashem, and
hereditary prince of the city, and custodian of the Temple,
of Mecca; the husband of Fatima, Mohammed’s favorite
and only surviving daughter, might reasonably claim for
himself and his two sons the inheritance of the prophet, who
had always delighted in calling him his vizir and vicegerent;
his valor and prowess had shone conspicuous in many a
hard-fought battle; and even his enemies could not impeach
the purity of his private life. But it so happened that Ali
had drawn upon himself the implacable hatred of Ayesha:
the conduct of this lady had, on one occasion, been rather
<em>indiscreet</em>, to use the very mildest term, and Ali had urged
his cousin to punish the frail fair. Mohammed was
indeed inclined to jealousy, but the youth, beauty, and
spirit of the daughter of Abu Bekr had established her
empire over her husband’s affections so firmly that he
rejected the clearest evidence of her faithlessness, inflicted
a severe chastisement upon her accusers, and reproved Ali
for his officiousness. Ayesha never forgave Ali the part he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
had played in this delicate affair, and the enmity she bore
him was still heightened by her jealousy of Fatima, to whom
she grudged the prophet’s paternal affection. Mohammed
would most probably have named Ali his successor&mdash;and
against the explicit nomination of the prophet, no voice
would have dared a protest&mdash;but the artful daughter of
Abu Bekr besieged his bed of sickness; and, turning the
ascendant she had acquired over the uxorious man to
excellent account, obtained from him that on the third day
before his death, when he was no longer able to proceed to
the mosque, he deputed Abu Bekr in his place to perform
the function of public prayer, instead of charging Ali with
that most honorable and important duty. After the death
of Mohammed, she boldly asserted that he had “appointed”
her father his successor in the royal and sacerdotal office.
The Koreish, and more especially the branch of Ommiyah,
the old enemies of the line of Hashem, eagerly espoused the
cause of Abu Bekr. The Ansars of Medina, and a few of
the Mohagerians of Mecca voted for Ali; the crafty Omar
was watching the event; a rash proposal made by one of
Ali’s supporters to <ins class="corr" id="tn-54" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'let each party chose'">
let each party choose</ins> their own Khalif,
and to divide the empire between them, brought the matter
to an abrupt termination. Omar, discerning the danger
which threatened the rising Saracen empire, if this proposal
were acted upon, renounced his own pretensions; and, setting
the regular forms of an election at naught, hailed Abu Bekr
as the first Khalif. The people acquiesced, and Mecca,
Medina, and most of the provinces of Arabia, acknowledged
Abu Bekr as commander of the Faithful. The Hashemites,
however, remained true to their chief, and Ali resisted for
six months the cajoleries of the Khalif and the threats of
Omar. But the death of his beloved Fatima subdued his
haughty spirit, and he consented at length to submit to
Abu Bekr’s rule. Strange enough, when Ali had made his
submission, the old man offered to resign in his favor; an
offer which was prudently declined.</p>

<p>During the later part of Mohammed’s life, several other
prophets had arisen in various parts of Arabia, and among
them one of some note, and of no mean skill in the apostolic
trade. His name was <span class="smcap">Moseilama</span>; the powerful tribe of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Hanifa, in the city of Yamanah, in Neged, listened to his
voice. Confident in his power, he coolly offered Mohammed
a partition of the earth between them. The prophet of
Islam treated the offer with disdain; but after his death,
several tribes, who had unwillingly embraced his creed,
seceded to the standard of the new prophet, who speedily
became a formidable rival to the Khalif. Mohammed’s uncle
Abbas and the fierce Kaled were dispatched against him by
Abu Bekr; but though forty thousand Moslems followed
their banner, the first action against Moseilama ended in
the defeat of Abbas and Kaled, and the former of the two
generals was severely wounded with a javelin. This defeat
was, however, fearfully avenged by Kaled; ten thousand
infidels were made to bite the dust, and the same javelin
that had pierced Abbas, was sent, a messenger of death, to
Moseilama’s heart, by the hand of an Ethiopian slave. The
submission of the revolted tribes speedily followed, and the
dread name of the <em>Sword of God</em> was in itself sufficient to
disarm all the other rebels who had risen in various parts
of the peninsula.</p>

<p>The victorious Kaled was now sent to the banks of the
Euphrates, where he reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 632), and, having slain the last of the Mondars of the
Arabian colony of Hira, and sent his son a captive to Medina,
prepared to invade the Persian empire; but in the midst of
his triumphant career, he was recalled and sent into Syria,
to take the command of the army there, and, in conjunction
with Abu Obeidah, to effect the reduction of that province
of the Greek empire. Bosra, a strong city situated four
days’ journey from Damascus, fell by his valor and by the
treachery of the Greek governor <span class="smcap">Romanus</span>. Damascus
was besieged (633); and an army of 70,000 Greeks, who
came to the relief of the hard-pressed city, under the
command of <span class="smcap">Werdan</span>, was totally defeated and dispersed
by 45,000 Moslems under Kaled, Amru, and Abu Obeidah,
at <span class="smcap">Aiznadin</span> (13th July, 633). Still Damascus resisted
stoutly for many months, sustained chiefly by the valor
of a noble Greek named <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>. At length, however, the
courage of the besieged gave way, and they surrendered to
the mild Abu Obeidah (most probably in August, 634), who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
granted them personal safety, and free possession of their
lands and houses, and to such of them as should prefer
exile to the Moslem rule, the permission to depart with
as much of their effects as they could carry away with them.
But the fierce and cruel Kaled refused to ratify these terms
of his fellow-commander: he slaughtered thousands of the
unfortunate Damascenes; and, though he consented at last
to abide by the terms of the capitulation, he only gave three
days respite to the band of voluntary exiles who left
Damascus under the leadership of the valiant Thomas. At
the expiration of this term, he set out in pursuit at the head
of four thousand horsemen; a miserable renegade, named
<span class="smcap">Jonas</span>, acted as guide. The hapless fugitives were overtaken,
and ruthlessly cut down to the last being of either
sex, with the solitary exception of the widow of the brave
Thomas, who was sent by Kaled to carry a message of
defiance to the throne of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the aged Abu Bekr, after a short reign of
two years, had been gathered to his fathers; Ayesha’s
influence and Omar’s craft had once more defeated Ali’s
claims to the vacant throne; and Omar had gained the
object of his ambition (24th July, 634). The new Khalif<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
proved himself worthy of this exalted position; his justice,
his wisdom, his moderation, and his frugality form, even to
the present day, among the <em>Sonnites</em>, the theme of the most
enthusiastic praise; though by the <em>Shiites</em> his memory is as
bitterly reviled, and the appellation <em>Shitan Omar</em>, which the
Persians so liberally bestow upon the second Khalif, shows
the sense which they entertain of his machinations against
the illustrious Ali. The son of Abu Taleb, however,
submitted to Abu Bekr’s choice, and was comforted for the
loss of empire by the most flattering marks of esteem and
confidence on the part of the new commander of the
Faithful.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of Omar’s reign was to remove Kaled
from the command of the Syrian army, under pretext of
excessive cruelty, and of rashness in the pursuit of the
Damascene exiles, but in reality because the Khalif bore a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
personal enmity to his invincible lieutenant. This made,
however, practically, no difference in the conduct of the
war; Kaled could command and obey with equal readiness,
and Abu Obeidah was modest and sensible enough to guide
himself in all important operations by the advice of his
former chief. After the reduction of Damascus, the Arabs
laid siege to Heliopolis (Baalbec) and Emesa, and speedily
compelled these important cities to surrender (635).
Heraclius made one last great effort to free Syria from
these most unwelcome visitors; he sent four-score thousand
veteran soldiers by sea and land to Antioch and Cæsarea;
this host was considerably increased by the remains of the
Syrian army, and by new levies in Syria and Palestine, and
joined also by 60,000 Christian Arabs under the banner of
<span class="smcap">Jabalah</span>,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> the last of the Gassanide princes. Upon Kaled’s
prudent advice, Abu Obeidah resolved to retire to the skirts
of Palestine and Arabia, and there to await the attack of the
enemy. In the vicinity of Bosra, on the banks of the
obscure river Yermuk (Hieromax), a fierce and bloody
encounter took place, in which the Greek forces were
totally routed (636); their Gassanide allies had already
previously met with the same fate at the hands of the
intrepid Kaled. After the victory of Yermuk, Abu Obeidah
resolved to invest <span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span> (or <span class="smcap">Ælia</span>, as the Romans
called it); he first sent <span class="smcap">Moawiyah</span>, Abu Sophian’s son,
with the van of five thousand Arabs, to try a surprise; and
this failing, he appeared himself, ten days after, with the
whole army.</p>

<p>After having endured four months the hardships of a
siege, the garrison and people of the holy city offered to
capitulate; but they demanded as a guarantee for the
articles of security, that the Khalif should ratify them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
person. Ali advised the Khalif to comply with this rather
unusual demand; and Omar set out from Medina, mounted
on a red camel, which carried, besides his person, a bag of
corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish, and a leathern bottle
of water! Jerusalem immediately surrendered (637), and
the Khalif returned promptly to Medina in the same simple
manner in which he had come. The conquest of Syria was
achieved the year after (638) by Abu Obeidah and Kaled,
who reduced Antioch, Aleppo, Tripoli, Tyre, Acca (St. Jean
d’Acre), Cæsarea, Ascelon, Hierapolis, and many other
cities and strong places. Abu Obeidah died 639, of a fatal
disease which carried off twenty-five thousand of the conquerors
of Syria; the hero Kaled, the <em>Sword of God</em>, survived
his fellow-commander about three years. The government
of the conquered province was entrusted by Omar to the
hands of Moawiyah, the chief of the family Ommiyah,
and who became afterwards the founder of the Ommiade
dynasty.</p>

<p>After Kaled’s <ins class="corr" id="tn-58" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'recal from the Persian'">
recall from the Persian</ins> frontier, the war
against the empire of the Magians was carried on languidly
for several years. In 636, however, Omar sent a new commander,
<span class="smcap">Said</span>, with considerable reinforcements to the army
on the Euphrates. After the murder of Chosroes II. and
Cobad II., in 628, eight kings of Persia had followed each
other in rapid succession, in the short space of three years.
At last, a woman, <span class="smcap">Arzema</span>, seized upon the throne; but, in
632, she was deposed, and the tiara transferred from her
head to that of the grandson of Chosroes, <span class="smcap">Yezdegerd</span> (III.),
a boy of fifteen. A dying effort was now made by the
Persians to drive back the Saracen invaders. An army
of 120,000 men, with 30,000 regulars among them, was
collected under <span class="smcap">Rustam</span>, who, urged on by his youthful
and inexperienced monarch, sought the Moslems in the
plains of <span class="smcap">Cadesia</span>, where Said had pitched his camp. The
Mussulman forces numbered only 30,000; the fight was
protracted for three whole days; it was bloody and obstinate
in the extreme; the Saracens lost one clear fourth of their
number; the fall of Rustam, on the third day, decided the
fate of the battle and of Persia (636). The standard of the
Sassanides (a leathern apron of a blacksmith, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
a profusion of precious gems) fell into the hands of the
conquerors. The province of Irak submitted to the Khalif,
who secured his conquest by the foundation of the city of
<span class="smcap">Basra</span>, or <span class="smcap">Bassora</span>, on the Shat-el-Arab (<em>i.e.</em>, the river
of the Arabs), which is formed by the junction of the
Euphrates and Tigris. The Moslems crossed the latter
river, and took and sacked <span class="smcap">Madayn</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ctesiphon</span>, the
capital of the Persian empire; immense treasures fell here
into their hands, more than sufficient indeed to enrich the
whole host of naked Arabians beyond their most sanguine
expectations. Many splendid works of art were destroyed
by the ruthless hands of the ignorant sons of the desert.
In one of the apartments of the white palace of Chosroes
Nushirvan, was found a magnificent carpet of silk, with the
picture of a garden embroidered on it in gold and precious
stones, imitating the natural colors of the flowers, fruits,
and shrubs depicted; Said preserved this splendid piece of
workmanship, and sent it to the commander of the Faithful;
but the precious gift found little favor in the sight of
Omar; that cynical gentleman quietly ordered the picture
to be destroyed, and divided the materials among his brethren
of Medina: the intrinsic value of these materials may be
conjectured from the fact, that Ali’s share alone was sold
for twenty thousand drachms of silver. A new city, <span class="smcap">Cufa</span>,
was founded on the western side of the lower Euphrates,
and the seat of government was removed to it from the
despoiled Madayn. One Persian province after the other
was compelled to submit to the Moslem sway; at Jalula,
Yezdegerd nobly contended once more for the empire of his
ancestors; in vain! the fanaticism of the Arabs proved
stronger than the despair of the Persians. Said had been
recalled, and <span class="smcap">Firuzan</span> sent in his place; the courage of the
Persian nation was not yet thoroughly subdued; 150,000
Persians attacked the Moslem host at <span class="smcap">Nehavend</span>, about
230 miles south of Hamadan; but though Firuzan had only
30,000 <ins class="corr" id="tn-59" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Musulmans to oppose'">
Mussulmans to oppose</ins> to the overwhelming numbers
of the Persians, and though the latter fought with true
bravery, fate had <ins class="corr" id="tn-59a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'decreed the downfal'">
decreed the downfall</ins> of the monarchy
of the Sassanides: the Arabians gained “the victory of
victories,” and the hapless Yezdegerd, worthy of a better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
fate, like Darius Codomannus, yielded up all hope of empire
(642).<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> After the victory of Nehavend, the cities of
Hamadan, Ispahan, Estachar (Persepolis), and many more,
were readily reduced, and the conquest of Persia was
achieved.</p>

<p>Whilst Persia was thus being added to the new Saracen
empire, another province was snatched from the feeble
emperor of Byzantium. Omar had cast his eyes upon
Egypt. With only 4000 Arabs, the valiant <span class="smcap">Amru</span> invaded
that country, in June, 638; after a siege of thirty days, he
took possession of Farmah, or Pelusium, the key of Egypt.
The reduction of Babylon, on the Eastern bank of the Nile,
opposite Memphis, the ancient capital of Egypt, took Amru
seven months, although he had received a reinforcement of
4000 men. On the spot where Amru’s army had pitched
their tents during the siege of Babylon, a new city arose,
which forms now part of an extensive suburb of Cairo, or
<span class="smcap">Al Cahira</span>, <em>i.e.</em>, the victorious, founded by the Fatimite
Khalifs (<span class="smcap">Moez</span>), in 970. Notwithstanding the capture of
Babylon and Memphis, Amru would probably have been
compelled to relinquish his attempt to conquer Egypt, had
not the Jacobite (Monophysite) Copts under Mokawkas,
who would have preferred the devil’s rule to that of their
Melchite<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> tyrants, joined the invaders heart and soul. Under
<em>their</em> guidance, and with <em>their</em> aid, Amru, who had, meanwhile,
been considerably reinforced from Syria, marched
from Memphis to <span class="smcap">Alexandria</span>; which latter city was, after
a series of preliminary combats, at last closely invested on
the land side. As the sea remained open, Heraclius might
have saved the great provision store of Byzantium, had he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
acted with the least energy; but the feeble old man contented
himself with <em>praying</em> for the relief of the besieged
city, and thought, perhaps, he had enlisted God on his side
by appointing a <em>priest</em> (the patriarch <span class="smcap">Cyrus</span>), to the præfecture
of Egypt, and the conduct of the war. No wonder then
that, notwithstanding a truly gallant defence by the inhabitants,
the city was, after a siege of fourteen months, at
length compelled to surrender (22nd of December, 640).
Omar’s commands preserved Alexandria from the horrors of
pillage. The story of the burning of the Alexandrian
library by order of Omar, is absolutely void of foundation;
the honor of the first invention of this calumnious lie
belongs (of course) to a Christian historian, <span class="smcap">Abulpharagius</span>,
primate of the Jacobites, who wrote 600 years after the
event: but a crowd of historians have since faithfully copied
it, even to its most extravagantly absurd details.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>With the reduction of Alexandria, the conquest of Egypt
was achieved, Amru carrying his victorious arms even
beyond the boundaries of that country as far as Tripoli.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
To facilitate the communication between Egypt and Arabia,
Omar constructed a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea.
Omar, the now mighty ruler of a most extensive empire,
was revolving new plans of conquest, when the dagger of
<span class="smcap">Firuz</span>, a Persian slave, who had been personally aggrieved
by the Khalif, cut short his thread of life&mdash;and saved the
world from subjugation; for what nation or empire could,
at that time, have long or successfully withstood the impetuous
tide, which, in the short space of ten years, had
engulphed Syria, Persia, and Egypt; and was full vigorous
enough to sweep over the whole earth, had but the master-mind
which had hitherto with rare wisdom directed its
enormous material force, continued to breathe an intelligent
will into it. Omar died in November, 644: urged to name
his successor, he had refused to do so, but had devolved
the task of choosing a new Khalif, on Ali and five others of
the most respectable companions of the prophet. The
illustrious son of Abu Taleb might now, indeed, have
ascended the vacant throne, had he deigned to promise a
servile conformity, not only to the Koran and tradition, but
also to the “sayings and doings” of his predecessors, Abu
Bekr and Omar. This demand his proud spirit rejected
with disdain. <span class="smcap">Othman</span>, also a son-in-law of the prophet,
and who had been his secretary, accepted the government
with these restrictions. The new Khalif was but little made
to sustain the weight of the Saracen empire. He was a
weak and vacillating old man, and led entirely by unworthy
favorites, more particularly by his secretary, <span class="smcap">Mervan</span>; he
was arrogant and overbearing withal, and in the space of a
few brief years, he excited the dissatisfaction and indignation
of even the most loyally disposed among his subjects. At
last the universal discontent was gathering to a head.
Resolved no longer to submit to the exactions of the
wretched favorites on whom the Khalif had conferred power
and station, the tribes rose in arms. From Cufa, from
Bassora, from Egypt, from the Desert, they marched on
Medina: they encamped about a league from the city,
and dispatched a haughty summons to their sovereign to
redress their grievances, or to give place to a more worthy
prince. Othman promised reformation, and Ali’s generous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
intercession might have succeeded in healing the breach
between the Khalif and his angry subjects; but Mervan’s
perfidy, and the deep intrigues of the artful Ayesha, defeated
all chances of reconciliation between the prince and the people.
In vain Othman ascended the pulpit, publicly and solemnly
to entreat Allah’s and the people’s forgiveness for his misrule;
he was pelted with stones, and carried home half dead.
The insurgents besieged him six weeks in his palace, intercepting
his water and provisions. The helpless old man had
to endure the grief of seeing himself forsaken and betrayed
by those on whom his misplaced favor had bestowed wealth
and power. Abandoning all hope, he calmly expected the
approach of death: a desperate band of fanatical Charegites,
with Mohammed, Ayesha’s brother, at their head, made their
way into his palace. They found him seated, with the Koran
in his lap; but neither the sacred book, nor his venerable
aspect, could disarm the assassins. Othman fell, pierced
with many wounds, 18th June, 655, in the eighty-second
year of his age.</p>

<p>During the reign of Othman, the island of Cyprus was
conquered by Moawiyah, in 647, and the island of Rhodes,
in 654; from the latter island, the Saracens carried off the
massy trunk and the huge fragments of the celebrated colossal
statue of Apollo, which had been overthrown about 800
years before by an earthquake. The large and once populous
country of Chorasan, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians,
was also “annexed” to the Saracen empire, during the reign
of Othman. In 647, <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span><a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and <span class="smcap">Zobeir</span> were sent with
40,000 Moslems to attempt the conquest of Africa. They
advanced to the walls of Tripoli, and endeavoured to carry
that maritime city by assault; they were, however, repulsed,
and the approach of a numerous army under the Greek
præfect Gregory, compelled them to raise the siege. By
Zobeir’s skill and valor, the Arabs gained a complete and
decisive victory over the hostile forces, the præfect himself
being slain by the hand of Zobeir. The opulent city of
Sufetula, situated 150 miles to the south of Carthage, fell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
into the hands of the victorious Arabs. Abdallah prudently
rested content with the advantages gained; he accepted the
offer of submission and tribute made on all sides by the
provincials, and retreated to the confines of Egypt (648).</p>

<p>Ali had made a perhaps somewhat lukewarm effort to
effect a reconciliation between Othman and his insurgent
subjects. When matters had proceeded to extremities,
he had sent his two sons, <span class="smcap">Hassan</span> and <span class="smcap">Hosein</span>, to the
rescue of the besieged Khalif; and Hassan, the eldest
of his sons, had, indeed, been wounded in the defence of
that unfortunate prince. Still Ali had not been very
energetic in his opposition to the rebels; and it is not
uncharitable to suppose, that the death of Othman caused
him no very bitter grief. Five days after the murder of the
aged Khalif, Ali was proclaimed his successor by acclamation.
The illustrious son of Abu Taleb was, indeed, a poet and a
hero, but a most indifferent statesman. <span class="smcap">Telha</span> and the
valiant <span class="smcap">Zobeir</span>, two of the most powerful of the Arabian
chiefs, who had had a hand in Othman’s overthrow and
death, and whose doubtful allegiance Ali ought to have
secured by rich gifts and greater promises, saw themselves
treated with studied coldness by the new Khalif, of whom
they had vainly solicited the government of Irak, as the
reward of their services. This impolitic conduct of Ali made
them inclined to lend a willing ear to the advice and suggestions
of the artful Ayesha, to raise the standard of revolt
against Ali, and to charge <em>him</em> with the perpetration of the
very crime which <em>she</em> had instigated, and <em>they</em> had lent their
aid to execute! The two chiefs, and the widow of the
prophet, escaped from Medina to Mecca, and from thence
to Bassora; the unblushing woman, whose own brother had
actually headed the assassins, had the almost incredible
effrontery to send Othman’s bloody shirt to the governor of
Syria, Moawiyah, Ali’s hereditary foe, and to call upon
him to avenge Othman’s blood upon his murderer&mdash;<em>Ali!</em>
The son of Abu Sophian was perfectly aware of the true
circumstances of the case; but it suited his ambitious
projects to <em>appear</em> to believe the infamous accusation against
the august chief of the line of Hashem, the more so as Ali
had expressed his intention to remove the head of the house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of Ommiyah from the government of Syria. Moawiyah,
therefore, exposed the bloody shirt of Othman in the principal
mosque of Damascus, and denouncing Ali as the
instigator of the sacrilegious deed, called upon the Faithful
to rise and avenge the death of the holy martyr, whose
lawful successor in the Khalifate he declared himself to be,
in obedience, as he pretended, to the express command of
the dying Othman. The appeal was numerously responded
to, and the ruler of Syria saw himself speedily at the head
of a formidable army; his friend, <span class="smcap">Amru</span>, whom Ali had
removed from the government of Egypt, espoused his cause.
Telha and Zobeir seized upon Irak; 50,000 Moslems
marched under their banner. At the head of 20,000 of his
loyal Arabs, and 9,000 auxiliaries of Cufa, the Lion of God
went to encounter his enemies. Under the walls of Bassora
(2nd and 3rd November, 656) was fought the first battle of
this civil war, which, destroying in internecine strife the
flower of the nation of the desert, may well be said to have
saved the world from the yoke of Islam; for had Ali been sole
and undisputed master of the Saracen empire, even the fire
of Callinicus<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> would have proved no effectual protection
against the then irresistible tide of Moslem conquest, and,
mayhap, the Isaurian might have indulged his iconoclastic
propensities at the head of a congenial host of image-haters;
nor would the west of Europe have escaped, and the champion
of the cross, the <em>Hammer</em> of Christ, might, perchance,
have figured in history as the <em>Ilderim</em> of Islam.</p>

<p>The rebels were totally defeated; Telha and Zobeir, with
10,000 of their host, were slain; and Ayesha, who, seated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in a litter perched on the back of a camel,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> had braved the
dangers of the field, animating the troops by her presence,
and cheering them on with her voice, fell a captive into the
hands of the man whom, with implacable hatred, she had
pursued so many years, and whom she had so grievously
injured; but the generous Ali disdained warring with
women. Mohammed’s widow was treated with every
respect due to her rank, and speedily dismissed to her
proper station at the tomb of the prophet. The victorious
Khalif, having in vain offered the most favorable terms of
accommodation to Moawiyah and Amru, took the field
against them at the head of 70,000 men, in the spring of
657. The plain of <span class="smcap">Siffin</span>, on the western bank of the
Euphrates, formed the field of ninety actions or skirmishes,
in a desultory warfare of one hundred and ten days. The
forces of the Ommiyah chief, are said to have amounted to
more than 120,000 men; among them many of the veterans
of the Persian, Syrian, and Egyptian campaigns; 45,000 of
that gallant band paid with their lives for the ambition of
their chief; 25,000 of Ali’s brave and loyal followers lay
slain by their side&mdash;a rare crop of blossoms for the garden of
the destroyer. The Lion of God was everywhere foremost
in the fight; his ponderous two-edged sword, wielded with
irresistible force, made fearful havoc in the hostile ranks;
every time he smote a rebel, he shouted his war-cry “Allah
Akbar!”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and the Arabian and Persian historians tell us
with all gravity, that “in the tumult of a nocturnal battle,
that tremendous exclamation was heard no less than four
hundred times.” Making all due allowance for Oriental
exaggeration, and striking one nought off the account,
enough still remains to make the feat a most respectable
achievement indeed.</p>

<p>The magnanimous Ali had proposed to settle the dispute
between him and Moawiyah by single combat; but to
encounter so formidable a champion would truly have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
sheer madness on the part of the prince of Damascus; he
therefore declined the Khalif’s courteous invitation. The
chief of the line of Ommiyah was not so redoubtable a
warrior as Ali, but he was a much better politician than the
true and lawful commander of the Faithful; clearly foreseeing
that the decision of the sword must in the end
inevitably turn against him, he devised a stratagem to
discomfit his dreaded antagonist, which being based upon a
crafty appeal to the reverential and superstitious feelings of
Ali’s followers, might reasonably be expected to have a fair
chance of success. The Khalif had resolved to terminate
the long-pending struggle by a decisive battle; the troops
were in presence, and the fight was on the point of being
engaged, when a solemn appeal to the books of the Koran,
which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost lances, made a
considerable portion of Ali’s forces pause in their onset;
emissaries of the prince of Damascus had long been busy
in the unsuspecting Ali’s ranks; his refusal to hold the
tradition, and the sayings and acts of Abu Bekr and Omar
as equally binding with the precepts of the Koran, was
regarded by many of his own followers as rank heresy; and
so it occurred that at the very time when victory seemed
secure in his grasp, the Khalif saw himself suddenly abandoned
by the greater half of his forces, and even compelled by
the vile rabble to submit his indefeasible right to a so-called
“arbitration;” Moawiyah being permitted to appoint his
friend and fellow-rebel, Amru, as arbiter on <em>his</em> part, whilst
Ali was forced by the treacherous crew around him to name
<span class="smcap">Musa</span>, the cadi of Cufa, a mixture in equal parts of stupidity
and conceit, to act on his behalf. The result was such as
might have been foreseen; the decision was in favor of
Moawiyah. Ali indignantly refused to be bound by it, as
it was but too patent that the whole “arbitration” had
been a disgraceful juggle from the beginning. But he was
abandoned by a great many of his former adherents, and
compelled to retreat to Cufa. Still he nobly carried on the
struggle against the vastly superior forces of his enemies,
and though Amru snatched Egypt from him, though Persia
and Yemen were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival of
Damascus, the final issue of the struggle might yet have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
been in his favor, had he not been foully murdered by a
Charegite,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> who with two other fanatics had agreed to give
peace to their troubled country by the removal of Ali,
Moawiyah, and Amru. Each of the three assassins chose
his victim, poisoned his dagger, and secretly repaired to the
scene of action; but the stroke was fatal only to the lawful
Khalif, though the prince of Damascus also was dangerously
hurt, and the deputy of the viceroy of Egypt paid with his
life for the honor of being mistaken for the illustrious
Amru (661).<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The dying Ali mercifully commanded his
children to dispatch his murderer by a single stroke. His
eldest son, <span class="smcap">Hassan</span>, was indeed saluted Khalif, by the party
who had faithfully adhered to the banner of the Lion of
God, but he was prevailed upon by Moawiyah to resign his
pretensions, and the son of Abu Sophian was acknowledged
the lawful commander of the Faithful; and Ali’s name was
ordered to be cursed from the pulpit.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The rule of the new Khalif was marked, upon the whole,
by wisdom and moderation. Moawiyah disdained the
simplicity of manners which had distinguished his predecessors;
he dressed in costly silks, surrounded himself
with a brilliant court, kept eunuchs for the guard of his
harem, and set the prophet’s precepts at naught in the
matter of wine-drinking. He would indeed shrink from no
crime where his political interests were or seemed concerned;
and the poisoning of Hassan, who had fondly, but foolishly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
hoped that the son of Abu Sophian would forget that the
title of Khalif had graced his name for however so short
a period of time, and the base murders of Kaled’s son,
Abderrahman, and of the bold-spoken Hadjir Ben Hadad,
who had dared publicly to protest against the cursing of
Ali’s name and memory, are by no means the only blots on
the reputation of the founder of the Ommiade dynasty; but
he was not cruel and blood-thirsty from mere wantonness
of disposition, and, as princes go, he was altogether rather
a favorable sample of the class than otherwise.</p>

<p>The first acts of his reign were to put down the rebellious
Charegites, and to quell an insurrection of the people of
Bassora. The three first Khalifs had resided at Medina;
political and strategic considerations had induced Ali to
transfer the seat of his government to Cufa. Moawiyah
made Damascus his capital, partly because Syria was the
stronghold of his power, and partly&mdash;and this was unquestionably
the principal reason&mdash;because his residence at
Medina would have materially interfered with the accomplishment
of the project nearest and dearest to his heart;
viz., to change the elective monarchy to an hereditary
kingdom. When he had firmly established his throne, he
prepared a powerful expedition by sea and land against
Constantinople (668); he entrusted the chief command to
the veteran <span class="smcap">Sophian</span>, and sent his own son Yezid to encourage
the troops by his presence and example. But though
the supineness of the Greeks permitted them to invest the
city of the Cæsars by sea and land, the Saracens met with a
more vigorous resistance than they had anticipated; the
solid and lofty walls of Byzantium, energetically defended
by a numerous and well-disciplined army, and by a people
aroused for a time to deeds of heroic devotion, by the danger
which threatened to overthrow the last bulwark of their
nationality and their religion, and the prodigious effect of
the fire of Callinicus, defeated all attempts to carry the city
by assault; and the Arabs, finding it a much easier task to
plunder the European and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis,
carried on the operations of the siege more and more
languidly, till, at last, having kept the sea from April to
September, they retreated, on the approach of winter, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the isle of Cyzicus, about eighty miles from the capital.
However, they renewed the attempt six successive summers,
until the enormous losses which they had suffered by fire
and sword, and by the mischances of shipwreck and disease,
compelled them finally to abandon the bootless enterprise
(675). This failure dimmed for a time the glory of the
Saracen arms, whilst it seemed to restore the former
prestige of the Roman name. The destruction of his fleets,
and the annihilation of his armies, had subdued the proud
spirit of Moawiyah; the aged Khalif had the mortification
of seeing himself insulted in his city and palace of Damascus
by the warlike Maronites, or Mardaites, of Mount Lebanon;
and he felt desirous of ending his days in tranquillity and
repose: he consented therefore to a peace, or truce, of thirty
years with the emperor Constantine IV. Pogonatus, in
which he indeed was permitted to retain possession of the
north-western part of Asia Minor, the island of Cyprus,
and the isles of the Greek Archipelago, but in which the
majesty of the commander of the Faithful was wofully
degraded, by the stipulation of an annual tribute to the
Court of Byzantium of three thousand pieces of gold, fifty
slaves, and fifty horses of a noble breed (677).</p>

<p>Moawiyah’s arms were more successful in other quarters.
His lieutenant, <span class="smcap">Obeidah</span>, invaded the territories of the
Turks, in 673, and made considerable conquests in Central
Asia; and a large portion of North Africa was added
to the Saracen empire by <span class="smcap">Akbah</span>, who conquered Tripoli
and Barca, founded the city of Cairoan, about fifty miles
south of Carthage,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> in 671, and advanced to the verge of the
Atlantic and the Great Desert. But the universal defection
of the Africans and Greeks, whom he had conquered,
recalled him from the shores of the Atlantic, where he was
already meditating a descent on Spain. Surrounded on all
sides by hostile multitudes, and despairing of succour, the
gallant Akbah, and his small force of brave men, had no
other resource left them but to die an honorable death,&mdash;they
fell to the last man. <span class="smcap">Zuheir</span>, sent with a new army,
avenged the fate of his predecessor; he vanquished the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
natives in many battles, but was himself overthrown in the
end by a powerful army, sent from Constantinople to the
relief of Carthage which he was besieging.</p>

<p>Moawiyah died on the 6th April, 680. Ten years before
his death he had seen his aspiring wishes crowned by the
proclamation of his son, <span class="smcap">Yezid</span>, as presumptive heir of the
Saracen empire.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> True, there had been some murmurs of
discontent, and it had even required an armed demonstration
against the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to enforce
submission to the will of the Khalif: but Moawiyah’s
vigor and address had triumphed over every obstacle.
Accordingly, after the father’s death, the son was acknowledged
as Khalif in every province of the vast empire; with
some partial exceptions, indeed, in Arabia proper, and more
particularly in Mecca and Medina. But Yezid had inherited
none of his father’s qualities; he was a dissolute voluptuarian,
and of a most tyrannical disposition withal. In the short
time of a few months, the discontent of his subjects had
risen to a threatening height; more especially in Arabia
proper, and in the province of Irak, People’s eyes began to
turn towards <span class="smcap">Hosein</span>, the younger and only surviving son of
Ali and Fatima, and head of the line of Hashem. Hosein
had served with distinction in the siege of Constantinople;
he had inherited some of his father’s spirit, and had disdainfully
refused to acknowledge Yezid’s title. He was invited
by a large body of the discontented in Irak, to come and
place himself at their head; against the advice of his wife
and many of his friends, he resolved to obey the call, and
set out with a small retinue, consisting, chiefly of women
and children. When he reached the confines of Irak,
<span class="smcap">Obeidollah</span>, the watchful and energetic governor of Cufa,
had already crushed the insurrection in the bud. In the
plains of Kerbela, Hosein found himself surrounded on all
sides by a body of five thousand horse. Unconditional
surrender or death was the only alternative offered to him;
he chose the latter, and, after deeds of the most heroic
valor, his generous band of devoted adherents were
all slain, basely butchered from afar with arrows by their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
cowardly assailants: he, alone, still survived, though bleeding
from many a wound. He seated himself at the door of his
tent, enfolding his youngest son and his nephew, two beautiful
children, in his arms; they were slain there, and their
warm life-blood overflowed the hands of the hapless man.
With a cry of grief and despair, he started up and threw
himself in the midst of the foe. The soldiers fell back on
every side, and, for a time, none dared to lay hands on the
grandson of the prophet; but, at last, one of their leaders,
the remorseless <span class="smcap">Shamer</span>, urged them to the attack, and the
heroic Hosein was slain, with three-and-thirty strokes of
lances and swords. The dead body was trampled under foot
by the inhuman wretches, and the severed head carried to
the castle of Cufa, and thence forwarded to Damascus, that
Yezid might look upon it and sleep in peace. An expedition
was sent against the holy cities, which, after Hosein’s death,
had acknowledged for <em>their</em> Khalif, <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> the son of
the valiant Zobeir. Medina was taken, and the sisters and
children of Hosein and Hassan were sent in chains to the
throne of Damascus. Yezid was urged by his advisers to
bury his fears for ever in the grave of the race of Ali and
Fatima. Now, had Yezid been one of the <em>Christian</em> Cæsars
of Byzantium, who “thought it no very great harm” to slay
even their own kindred, or to deprive them of sight, or
mutilate them in some other way, if undisputed empire could
but be secured thereby, no doubt the advice would have been
followed to the letter: but the grandson of the wild Henda was
not altogether without some of the better feelings of human
nature, and the <em>Saracen</em> Khalif had no convenient “patriarch,”
or bishop, at hand to lull his troublesome conscience
by the mockery of priestly absolution. The mourning
family were honorably dismissed to Medina, and Yezid even
strove to console them for the irreparable losses they had
suffered at his father’s and his own hands.</p>

<p>The partial successes of Yezid’s generals against Abdallah
did not prevent that indefatigable warrior from seizing upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Yemen, and establishing his power in Egypt. After a
troubled reign of three years, Yezid died (683); and a few
months after his death, his son and successor, <span class="smcap">Moawiyah II.</span>,
preferred voluntary abdication to the desperate struggle
which he foresaw it would cost to oust Abdallah from his
usurped position. For a time, complete anarchy ensued:
Obeidollah, the governor of Irak, attempted to found a new
empire and a new dynasty, in Bassora, but he was ignominiously
expelled by the people; and the provinces of Irak,
Yemen, Hejaz, and Egypt, acknowledged the name and
sovereignty of Abdallah. Even in Syria, a creature of
Abdallah’s, <span class="smcap">Dehac</span>, was, for a time, obeyed as vicegerent.
At last, however, <span class="smcap">Mervan</span>, of the line of Ommiyah, was
saluted Khalif in Damascus (684), on condition, however,
as he bound himself by oath, to name Kaled, Yezid’s younger
son, his successor. Mervan speedily succeeded in subjecting
Syria and Egypt to his sway. The people of Chorasan,
where the Hashemites had gained considerable ascendancy,
renounced their allegiance to the empire, proclaimed their
independence, and elected the noble <span class="smcap">Salem</span> their king.
<span class="smcap">Soliman</span>, the son of Zarad, excited a formidable insurrection
in Arabia Proper, and in part of Syria, and proclaimed the
deposition of both rival Khalifs; but he was defeated by
Obeidollah. Mervan, forgetful of his oath, proclaimed his
son, <span class="smcap">Abd-el-Malek</span>, his successor; he fell by the dagger of
his offended kinsman, Kaled (685). But Abd-el-Malek
made good his claim to the succession, and set diligently
about to strengthen his position in the provinces which his
father had wrested from Abdallah’s grasp. In Abd-el-Malek
the latter found an antagonist worthy of himself, both in
valor and wile. The actual struggle between the two rivals
was, however, postponed for a season by the appearance of
a third party on the scene,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mokhtar</span>, another inspired
prophet, and whose chances of establishing <em>another</em> new
creed seemed, for a time, to promise rather fair; in fact, the
city of Cufa, and part of the province of Irak, had acknowledged
his divine mission, when Abdallah’s good sword
proved him an impostor (686). The Greeks had, meanwhile,
taken advantage of the distress and fears of the house of
Ommiyah, but in their own paltry and pettifogging way;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
for instead of boldly drawing the sword to wrest Asia Minor,
Palestine, and Syria from the enfeebled grasp of the divided
Saracens, they were content with obtaining from Abd-el-Malek
a considerable increase of the tribute.</p>

<p>Abd-el-Malek, relieved thus from his apprehensions of a
war with the Eastern empire, could now turn his undivided
attention to the impending struggle with the rival Khalif
of Mecca. After five years’ fierce and doubtful contest,
Abdallah was at length defeated in a decisive battle, and
compelled to take refuge in Mecca; here he defended himself
for seven months against Abd-el-Malek’s vastly superior
forces. At last, in a general assault, the valiant son of
Zobeir was slain; his fall decided that of the city, and the
Saracen empire was thus again united under one ruler
(692). As soon as Abd-el-Malek saw himself sole and
undisputed Khalif, he threw off the badge of servitude to
the Eastern empire, which the internal dissensions and
troubles of the preceding years had compelled him to submit
to. He discontinued the payment of the stipulated tribute,
and even wrested another province, Armenia, from the feeble
hands of the Byzantine Cæsars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hassan</span>, the governor of Egypt, was charged with the
task to reconquer the north of Africa. That brave and
skilful commander, after having subdued the provinces of
the interior, carried his victorious arms to the sea-coast,
and took, by a sudden assault, the fortifications of
Carthage, the metropolis of Africa (697). However, the
unexpected arrival of a powerful Greek fleet, with a
numerous and well-appointed army<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> on board, compelled
the Arabian general to evacuate his recent conquest, and to
retire to Cairoan. <ins class="corr" id="tn-74" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'But Abd-eb-Malek had'">
But Abd-el-Malek had</ins> resolved to annex
North Africa to his dominions at any cost; he prepared
therefore during the winter a powerful armament by sea and
land, and in spring, 698, Hassan appeared once more before
Carthage, and compelled the præfect and patrician John,
who commanded the Greek forces, to evacuate the city;
soon after, he defeated him again in the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
of Utica, and a precipitate embarkation alone saved the
remains of the Byzantine army from absolute annihilation.
Carthage was reduced to a heap of ruins. But Hassan had
soon to encounter a more formidable enemy: a prophetess
arose among the <span class="smcap">Moors</span>, or <span class="smcap">Berbers</span>, of the interior, and
boldly challenged the Arabian invaders to make good
their claim to the land which they had fondly deemed
subdued with the expulsion of the Greeks. <span class="smcap">Cahina</span> was
the name of this extraordinary woman, who seemed to have
discovered the secret of breathing into her people a spirit
of enthusiasm superior even to the fanaticism of the
Moslems. In a single day Africa was lost again to the
Saracens, and the humbled Hassan retired to the confines
of Egypt, where he expected, five years, the promised
succour of the Khalif. But Queen Cahina’s order to
destroy the cities, and to cut down the fruit-trees, filled the
Christian population of the coast with apprehension and
anger; and when Hassan at last made his reappearance in
the province, he was hailed, even by the most zealous
Catholics, as a deliverer and saviour. The royal prophetess
boldly accepted battle; but she was slain, and her army
was put to the rout (705). Still the spirit of resistance
survived, and Hassan’s successor, the aged but fiery <span class="smcap">Musa
Ben Nassir</span>, had to quell a new insurrection of the Moorish
tribes. He and his two sons, <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span> and <span class="smcap">Abdelaziz</span>,
succeeded so well, however, that not only did the Berbers
submit to the Khalif, but they even embraced the religion
of Islam, and became henceforth as one people with their
Arabian conquerors.</p>

<p>Abd-el-Malek was the first Khalif to establish a
national mint, both for silver and gold coin (695); the gold
coins were imitations of the Roman gold denar, with an
inscription proclaiming the unity of the God of Mohammed;
the Arabs called these gold coins, <em>dinars</em>; their value was
about eight shillings sterling. It would appear they struck
also double, and half, dinars. The silver coin might represent
a value of fivepence or sixpence English money.
Abd-el-Malek died in 705. He was succeeded by his son
<span class="smcap">Walid</span>, a prince who, indeed, did not inherit the activity,
vigor, and decision of his father; but was, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
hand, free also from the cruelty and the low avarice that
stained the character of Abd-el-Malek. Walid loved and
encouraged arts and sciences, and more especially architecture:
he built the splendid mosque of the Ommiades at
Damascus, at an expense of half a million sterling; he
rebuilt also Mohammed’s mosque at Medina, on a larger
and more magnificent scale. He had the good fortune to
be served by clever ministers and great generals, whose
energy, valor, and enterprise amply made up for the personal
indolence and inactivity of the Khalif, and imparted a glory
to his reign, rivalling that of Omar’s. One of his lieutenants,
<span class="smcap">Catibah</span> (<em>the camel driver</em>), added to the Saracen empire
the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jaxartes, and
the Caspian sea, with the rich and populous commercial
cities Carizme, Bochara, and Samarcand (707-710). From
Samarcand, the victorious general sent his master a daughter
of <span class="smcap">Phirouz</span>, or <span class="smcap">Firuz</span>, the son of the unfortunate Yezdegerd,
the last of the Sassanide rulers of Persia, who became
Walid’s wife. Mohammed, one of Catibah’s colleagues,
displayed the banner of Islam on the opposite banks of the
Indus (712); and in the same year, Fargana, the residence of
the Chagan of the Turks, was taken by Catibah, who advanced
as far as Cashgar, where he received an embassy from the
Emperor of China. Walid’s brother, <span class="smcap">Moslemah</span>, one of the
most redoubtable of the Mussulman warriors known to history,
defeated the Chazars in the Caucasus, and annexed Galatia
and other parts of Asia Minor to the empire of his brother
(710). But the greatest and most glorious conquest was
that of Spain. As early as the time of Othman, the Arabs
had cast a longing eye upon the fair land of <em>Handalusia</em>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and their piratical squadrons had more than once ravaged
the Spanish coast. The Gothic king, <span class="smcap">Wamba</span>, had defeated
one of their expeditionary corps in 675. Since that time no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
further attempt had been made on the kingdom of the
Visigoths; but the latter, beholding with apprehension
the establishment of the Arabian power in North Africa,
had, in 697, aided the Byzantine emperor in the attempted
relief of Carthage. The king of Spain possessed on the
African coast the fortress of <span class="smcap">Ceuta</span> (<em>Septa</em> or <em>Septum</em>), one
of the columns of Hercules, which is divided by a narrow
strait from the opposite pillar or point on the European
coast. This fortress was held at the beginning of the eighth
century by the Gothic Count <span class="smcap">Julian</span>, brother-in-law of
<span class="smcap">Oppas</span>, archbishop of Toledo and Seville, whose brother,
<span class="smcap">Witiza</span>, was then king of Spain. In 709, Musa made an
attempt to reduce Ceuta, and subdue the small portion of
Mauritania which was still wanting to the conquest of North
Africa; but he was repulsed by Count Julian with considerable
loss, and would most probably have relinquished
his project upon Spain, had not internal dissensions among
the Gothic magnates unexpectedly opened to him a fair
prospect of success. King Witiza had attempted to
reform the truly appalling licentiousness of the Spanish
clergy, and to curb the overgrown power of the nobility;
but lacking both the crafty wile of the eleventh Louis of
France, and the strong despotic will of the Tudors of
England, his well-meant efforts simply led to his own
deposition (710), which he survived only a few months.
The clergy and nobility elected a king after their own heart,
in the person of <span class="smcap">Roderic</span>, a grandson of King <span class="smcap">Reccaswinth</span>
(or Receswinth<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>). The two sons of Witiza, and
their uncle Oppas, conspired to overthrow the new
monarch, who, it would appear, had been indiscreet enough
to express his intention of removing Count Julian from his
Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, the moment he
should think himself sufficiently powerful to give due force
to his royal decrees.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The threatened count was readily
induced to join the party of the conspirators; but dreading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
lest the force which they could bring into the field, should
prove unavailing against the monarch’s power, he, who had
hitherto been the staunchest defender of his country, did
not hesitate to betray her to the Saracen foe, and to open
wide the portals that had been entrusted to his honor and
patriotism to guard. He and his fellow-conspirators endeavored
to soothe the misgivings of conscience with Musa’s
deceptive assurance, that he did not intend to establish
himself in Spain, but would rest content with a share of the
spoil.</p>

<p>As soon as Musa had obtained Walid’s sanction to the
contemplated enterprise, he sent off an expedition of only
four vessels, with five hundred men on board, to explore the
coast of the coveted land. <span class="smcap">Tarif Abu Zara</span>, the commander
of this force, landed on the opposite side of the
strait, and marched eighteen miles into the interior, to the
castle and town of the traitor Count of Ceuta<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> (July 710).
His glowing report of the wealth of the country, decided
Musa to send over a more powerful expedition under the
command of his freedman, <span class="smcap">Tarik Ben Zayad</span>. The miserable
Julian supplied the means of transport. Five thousand
Arabs and seven thousand Moors landed at the European
pillar of Hercules, Mount Calpe, which became, henceforth,
the Mountain of Tarik&mdash;<em>Gebel al Tarik</em>, a name corrupted
afterwards into the present appellation of Gibraltar (April,
711). Here Tarik formed a strongly entrenched camp, and
gathered around him the friends of Julian, and also many
Jews who were fired with the most deadly hatred against
their Christian persecutors, that had, for more than a century,
oppressed and hunted down this doomed people with
a malignity such as religious fanaticism alone can excite
and sustain. Counts <span class="smcap">Edeco</span> and <span class="smcap">Theodemir</span>, who had been
commanded by the king to expel the intruders, were defeated
with great slaughter; and a seasonable reinforcement from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Africa swelled Tarik’s ranks to above 30,000 men. Roderic,
conscious at last of the magnitude of the danger that
threatened to overwhelm his throne and his people, gathered
the flower of the Gothic nation around him, and marched
at the head of 100,000 men to encounter the foreign invaders.
In the neighbourhood of Cadiz, at Xeres de la
Frontera, on the Guadelete, the hostile armies met. Three
days were spent in desultory, though bloody fighting; on
the fourth day, the actual battle commenced. When night
spread her sable wings, and bade the slaughter cease for a
while, more than half of the Saracen forces lay stretched
dead on the ground they had come to conquer; and had not
the vile defection of the most reverend father in God, the
Archbishop of Toledo, and his two nephews, to whom
Roderic’s generous or foolish (it may be read both ways)
confidence had entrusted the most important post, broken
the ranks of the Christians, the severed head of Musa’s
freedman might have graced the battlements of Toledo. As
it was, it took three days to scatter the remains of the
Gothic army; and many a Saracen, and many a Christian
traitor to his country, had to bite the dust before Tarik could
pen his laconic “Praise be to Allah!&mdash;we have conquered.”
(July 19-26, 711). The hapless king of the Goths was
either slain in the fight or drowned in the waters of the
Guadalquivir. The field of Xeres decided the fate of the
Gothic monarchy; nearly the whole of Spain submitted to
Tarik with such extraordinary rapidity, that the good old
Musa, envious of his freedman’s success and fame, bade him
arrest his victorious course, until he himself should arrive
to gather the last and fairest fruits of the victory. Tarik,
however, added Cordova and Toledo, the capital of the
Gothic kingdom, to the list of his conquests, and advanced
as far as the Bay of Biscay, where the failure of land at last
compelled him to stop. Here he received an angry and
imperious summons from his jealous chief; who had, meanwhile,
himself crossed over from Africa, at the head of ten
thousand Arabs and eight thousand Moors, and had taken
Seville, and was besieging Merida. The latter city, though
valiantly defended, was at last compelled to surrender.
Midway between Merida and Toledo, Tarik met his chief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
who received him with cold and stately formality, and
demanded a strict account of the treasures of the conquered
kingdom. The unfortunate lieutenant speedily found that
Musa would not readily forgive his presumption of subduing
Spain in the absence of his general: he saw himself ignominiously
deprived of his command, and thrown into prison;
and Musa carried his resentment so far, that he ordered the
conqueror of Spain to be publicly scourged. Walid’s imperative
commands compelled Musa to restore Tarik to his
position; and the valiant man, who had been so ungenerously
and unworthily treated by the jealous old chief, assisted
him with his accustomed zeal, in achieving the conquest
of the still unsubdued parts of the peninsula. At the end
of 712, all resistance had ceased on the part of the Christians,
with the exception of the valiant prince <span class="smcap">Theodemir</span>,
who defended himself several months longer in Orihuela,
and obtained, at last, most favorable terms from Musa’s
son, Abdelaziz, (5th April, 713); and the invincible
<span class="smcap">Pelagius</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pelayo</span>, and <span class="smcap">Petrus</span>, who, in the Asturian,
Gallician, and Biscayan vallies, laid the foundation of a new
Christian empire in Spain; destined, after a time, to renew
the struggle and ultimately to expel the foreign invaders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musa</span> was a very old man&mdash;but though the coloring of
his beard, and other little expedients of art, might fail to
obliterate the physical ravages wrought by eighty-eight
years of life, and by the fatigues and privations of fifty
campaigns<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>&mdash;yet the vigor of his mind, and the youthful
ardor that fired his breast, remained unimpaired: and, like
that marvellous old man of a later period, great <span class="smcap">Dandolo</span>,
the approach of ninety found him revolving enterprises of
stupendous magnitude; aye, no less than the conquest of
Gaul, Italy, Germany, and the Greek empire. He was
preparing to pass the Pyrenees,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and bid the kingdom of
the Franks cease to exist, when an imperious command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
from Damascus, called both him and Tarik thither, to render
an account of their proceedings to the commander of the
faithful. Tarik obeyed; Musa delayed complying with the
Khalif’s summons, until a second and still more peremptory
message left the old chief no other alternative but obedience
or open rebellion: and, as his own loyalty, or that of his
troops, put the latter out of question, he set at once diligently
about preparing for his return to Damascus. He
confided the government of Spain to his son, <span class="smcap">Abdelaziz</span>;
that of Africa, to his son, <span class="smcap">Abdallah</span>. Taking with him
immense treasures in gold and silver, and, among others,
the famous emerald table of Solomon, encircled with pearls
and gems&mdash;a spoil of the Romans from the east, and
which, it would appear, had fallen into the hands of Alaric,
in the sack of Rome<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> (410, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>); and attended by thirty
Gothic princes, 400 nobles, and 18,000 male and female
captives of humbler degree, he set out from Ceuta on his way
to Damascus. At Tiberias, in Palestine, he received a private
message from <span class="smcap">Suleiman</span>, or <span class="smcap">Soliman</span>, the brother and
presumptive heir of Walid, informing him that the Khalif
was dying, and commanding him, as he valued Soliman’s
friendship, to reserve his triumphal entry into Damascus
for the inauguration of the new reign.</p>

<p>Musa, who might deem Soliman’s anger less dangerous
than the resentment of the Khalif should he recover, disregarded
the injunction, and pursued his march to Damascus,
where he arrived just in time to afford the dying Walid the
gratification of beholding the spoils of Africa and of Spain,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
soon after which, the most powerful of the Khalifs bowed
his head to the stroke of the mighty master of kings and
emperors (October, 714). His successor, <span class="smcap">Soliman</span>, was an
able and energetic prince, but of a despotic and ruthless
disposition. Musa was arraigned at the judgment seat of
the new Khalif, for abuse of power and disobedience to
orders. The unworthy treatment which the victor of Xeres
had suffered at the hands of his jealous chief, was avenged
by a similar indignity inflicted upon the latter: the veteran
commander was publicly scourged, and then kept waiting
a whole day before the palace gate, till the “<em>mercy</em>” of
Soliman accorded him a sentence of exile to Mecca. He
was, moreover, adjudged to pay to the public treasury, a fine
of 200,000 pieces of gold. Afraid lest the sons of the
despoiled and insulted old man, should attempt to avenge
the injuries of their father, the worthy son of Abd-el-Malek
secretly dispatched to Africa and Spain, decrees commanding
the extermination of Musa’s family; and, by a refinement
of cruelty worthy of a Caligula, Caracalla, or Justinian II.,
he had the head of Abdelaziz presented to the bereaved
father, with an insulting question, whether he knew the
features of the rebel? “I know his features,” exclaimed
the hapless old man, in a paroxysm of grief and indignation;
“he was loyal and true. May the same fate overtake the
base authors of his death!” &mdash; &mdash; &mdash; Musa’s death, a few
weeks after, of the anguish of a broken heart, spared Soliman
an additional crime. The victor of Xeres fared but little
better than his ancient commander; though, indeed, he was
not made to expiate by death, imprisonment, or exile, the
great services which he had rendered his country. <span class="smcap">Catibah</span>,
who had every reason to dread a similar fate as Musa’s and
Tarik’s, rose in arms against the jealous tyrant of Damascus,
and had the good fortune to meet with a glorious death on
the battle field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>Soliman resolved to render his reign famous by the
overthrow of the Greek empire, and the conquest of
Constantinople. His preparations, both by land and sea,
were made on a gigantic scale. His brother, the redoubtable
<span class="smcap">Moslemah</span>, invaded Asia Minor at the head of 70,000
foot and 50,000 horse, with an immense train of camels,
(716). The city of Tyana fell into the hands of the
Moslems, and Amorium was closely besieged by them. The
troops in Amorium were commanded at the time by General
<span class="smcap">Leo</span>, a native of Isauria. The original name of this
remarkable man, was <span class="smcap">Konon</span>; his father had come over
from Asia Minor to Thrace, and had settled as a grazier
there. He must have acquired considerable wealth in that
lucrative business, since he could afford a gift of 500 sheep
to the Imperial camp, to procure for his son admission into
the guards of Justinian. The personal strength of the
young soldier, and his dexterity in all martial exercises
attracted the notice of the emperor, who speedily advanced
him to the higher grades of military rank. Anastasius II.
confided to him the command of the Anatolian legions, and
it was in this capacity that he defended Amorium against
the Saracens. One of those sudden revolutions so frequent
in the Byzantine court, compelled Anastasius to hand over
the sceptre to an obscure officer of the revenue, who
assumed the name of Theodosius III. General Leo refused
to acknowledge the new emperor, and managed so skilfully,
that not only did the troops under his command invest <em>him</em>
with the imperial purple, but the Arabs, it would appear,
accorded him and his army free and undisturbed departure
from Amorium. He marched upon Constantinople, and
Theodosius seeing himself in danger of being abandoned by
the very troops who had so recently exalted him, willingly
resigned to the hands of the general and emperor of the
Oriental troops, the sceptre which, moreover, he had accepted
with extreme reluctance only. He was permitted to retire
with his son to the shelter of a monastery, where he had
ample time to paint golden letters, an occupation which
marvellously suited the natural indolence of his disposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo</span>, third of the name, who figures in history usually as
the <em>Isaurian</em>, or the <em>Iconoclast</em>, was fully aware of the intention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
of the Arabs to attempt the reduction of Constantinople;
he, therefore, made every preparation which military experience
could suggest, or engineering skill devise, to give
them a fitting reception. In July, 717, after the reduction
of Pergamus, Moslemah transported his army from Asia to
Europe, across the Hellespont or Dardanelles, at the most
narrow part of the passage (from Abydos to Sestos); and
thence, wheeling his troops round Gallipoli, Heraclea, and
the other Thracian cities of the Propontis, or Sea of Marmara,
he invested Constantinople on the land side. An offer made
by the Greeks, to purchase the withdrawal of the besieging
forces by the payment of a piece of gold for each inhabitant
of the city, was contemptuously rejected; and Moslemah
pushed on the operations of the siege with the greatest
vigor, but without any corresponding success, the Isaurian
repelling every attack with a bravery and determination,
such as the Saracens had but little expected to see displayed
by the apparently effete Greeks. Moslemah’s hopes were
swelled high, however, by the arrival of the navies of Syria
and Egypt, to the number of 1800 vessels,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> with 50,000
men on board. The Saracen commander fixed a night for
a general assault by land and sea, and proudly boasted that
by the morning the city should be his. When that morning
came, the Greek fire had done its work; and scarce a vestige
remained of the proud fleet, or of those who had manned it;
and ten thousand Arabs and Persians slain, bore witness
how fiercely Moslemah had assaulted the defences of
Byzantium, and how bravely and vigorously the Isaurian
and his gallant troops had repulsed the hostile multitudes.
From this check, Moslemah essayed in vain to recover: he
became soon painfully conscious that the conviction of invincibility,
which had hitherto so materially contributed to the
great successes of the Saracen arms, was, if not altogether
destroyed, at least considerably shaken. His assaults were
now repulsed with apparent ease almost, and all his attempts
at surprises were defeated by the ever watchful Isaurian.
One hope still remained to restore the ancient supremacy of
the Moslem arms: Khalif Soliman had gathered a formidable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
host of Arabians, Persians, and Turks, and was preparing
to lead them to his brother’s assistance. The eyes of both
the besiegers and the besieged were anxiously turned towards
the Khalif’s camp near Chalcis (or Kinnisrin) in Syria;
and Leo was endeavoring, by gifts and promises, to attract
an army of Bulgarians from the Danube to pit them against
the Saracens; and thus, perchance, to free the Byzantine
empire from all danger, by the mutual destruction of its
Barbarian foes. But it so happened that the Commander
of the Faithful could not command his appetite; a meal of
two scores or so of eggs, and a matter of six or seven pounds
of figs, followed up by a dessert of marrow and sugar, proved
too much for even his well-seasoned stomach; he paid with
his life the penalty of his gluttony (717). He had appointed
his cousin, <span class="smcap">Omar Ben Abdelaziz</span>, to succeed him in the
khalifate. Omar, second of the name, was a most estimable
man, but a very indifferent prince; much fitter, indeed, to
be the head of a monastery of ascetics, than of a powerful
empire. The first act of his reign was to order the cessation
of the Syrian armaments, which might have been a wise
measure, had it been accompanied <ins class="corr" id="tn-85" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'by the recal of'">
by the recall of</ins> Moslemah
and his forces from the siege of Constantinople. His neglect
of the latter measure entailed upon the unfortunate natives
of the sultry climes of Egypt and Arabia, the unspeakable
hardships of a most severe winter, passed in a frozen camp.
In spring (718), he made an effort to relieve their wants,
and to fill up the gaps which cold, famine, and disease had
made in the ranks of the besieging army. Two numerous
fleets were sent on this errand, one from Alexandria, the
other from the ports of Africa. They succeeded, indeed, in
landing the stores and reinforcements, but they found it as
vain to contend against the Greek fire, as the armada which,
the year before, had so proudly threatened to erase the
Roman name from among the nations. Meanwhile, the
Bulgarians had been bribed into an alliance with the Greek
emperor, and these savage auxiliaries proved formidable
antagonists to the exhausted and half-starved Asiatics.
Still the intrepid Moslemah was not dismayed, and although
he was compelled to relinquish all further attempts upon the
defences of the city, he defeated, on his part, all attacks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
made on his camp: until, at length, Khalif Omar sent him
the welcome order to raise the siege, (August, 718). The
retreat of the Arabian forces was effected without delay or
molestation; but of the fleet, tempests destroyed what the
fire of Callinicus had spared, and of 700 vessels that had
proudly sailed forth, five only returned to the port of Alexandria,
to tell the sad tale of the disastrous loss of their
companions. Byzantium was saved, and the victorious
Isaurian found himself at liberty to prepare for his meditated
warfare against canvas, wood, brass, and marble.</p>

<p>The good and pious Omar distinguished his reign chiefly
by the abolition or “repeal” of the curse against Ali and
his adherents which had for nearly sixty years been daily
pronounced from the pulpits (719). By this act of simple
justice, and by his somewhat hasty and incautious attempts
to reform the fearful abuses which had crept into the
administration of the empire under his predecessors, he
excited the determined hostility of his own family, and of
the Vizirs and high officers of state. A dose of poison
removed him (720). His successor, <span class="smcap">Yezid II.</span>, had none
of his virtues, but most of the vices of his other predecessors
of the line of Ommiyah. It was in the reign of
this prince, and in that of his successor, that the family
Hashem, in two of its branches, viz. the <span class="smcap">Alides</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Fatimites</span>, i.e. the descendants of Ali and Fatima, and
the <span class="smcap">Abassides</span>, that is the descendants of Abbas, the uncle
of the prophet, began to urge their claims to the throne of
the Khalifa. Indeed, Mohammed, the great grandson of
Abbas, was secretly acknowledged as the true commander
of the Faithful, by a considerable body of the inhabitants
of Chorasan, and his son <span class="smcap">Ibrahim</span> was even enabled to
hoist the black flag of the Abassides<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in that province; the
gloomy banner was triumphantly borne onward by <span class="smcap">Abu
Moslem</span>, the intrepid and invincible champion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
Abassides, the <em>King-maker</em> of the East, but, who was fated
at last, like the English King-maker, to experience the
usual gratitude of princes. From the Indus to the
Euphrates, the East was convulsed by the fearful struggle
between the white and the black factions, and the fairest
provinces of Asia were deluged with blood to void the
ancient quarrel between Ommiyah and Hashem, and to
decide which of two equally vile races of despots had
the <em>better right</em> to trample on God’s fair creation. The
struggle terminated for a time in 750, with the overthrow
and almost total extirpation of the Ommiades&mdash;but of this
hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yezid</span> died in 722 or 723, of grief for the death of a
favorite concubine. He was succeeded by his brother
<span class="smcap">Hesham</span>, a prince not altogether destitute of good qualities.
Hesham had to contend against the Fatimite <span class="smcap">Zeid</span>, the
grandson of Hassan, who was, however, speedily overcome,
and had to pay with his life the penalty of his ambition.
The struggle against the more successful Abassides has been
mentioned in the preceding paragraph.</p>

<p>After Musa’s departure from Spain, and the murder of
his son Abdelaziz, <span class="smcap">Ajub</span> was proclaimed by the Arabian
and Moorish troops, governor of the Spanish peninsula;
he fixed his residence at Cordova. Under him and his
more immediate successors numerous colonies came over to
Spain from various parts of the Saracen dominions in Asia
and Africa; of these the royal legion of Damascus was
planted at Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of
Chalcis at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina
Sidonia. The Egyptian bands were permitted to share with
the original conquerors their establishments of Murcia and
Lisbon. The immigrants from Yemen and Persia were
located round Toledo, and in the inland country; and ten
thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the
purest and most noble Arabian tribes, settled in the fertile
seats of Grenada.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ajub’s</span> successor in the government of Spain, <span class="smcap">El Horr
Ben Abderrahman</span> resolved to annex to the dominions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
under his sway the Gallic province of Septimania or
Languedoc, of which the eastern part, with Narbonne and
Carcassone, was still remaining in the hands of the
Visigoths; the western part, Aquitaine and Thoulouse having
been severed from the Gothic kingdom in 508, by Clovis.
But he was defeated and driven back by the Christians; in
consequence of the ill-success of his operations, the Khalif
removed him from the command, and named <span class="smcap">El Zama</span>
governor in his stead. That bold and skilful general
speedily succeeded in reducing the whole of the Narbonnese
province (720); whence he marched into Aquitaine, and laid
siege to Thoulouse. Here he found a more formidable foe
to encounter&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Franks</span>, who were ultimately to check
the further advance of Islam and its followers into the
fairest provinces of Europe. The history of that nation,
and of its successful leader against the Saracen invaders,
forms the subject of the second part of this volume.</p>

amount of latent heat, considering that, even admitting the
library to have existed at the time, and conceding to it the largest
number of volumes claimed by the most extravagant writers, viz.,
720,000, one single volume per day must have sufficed to heat a public
bath! Verily, verily, history is made the most inexact of all sciences.
The flames which Cæsar was compelled to kindle in his defence, in the
Bruchion (the Belgravia or Tyburnia of the city of Alexander); the
havoc and depredation committed by the Alexandrian mob during the
troubles of the <em>shoes</em> (so called from the circumstance that these
terrible troubles, which are said to have lasted above twelve years
[from 261 to 273 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>], were first occasioned by a dispute between a
soldier and a townsman about a pair of shoes); and the destruction
inflicted on the Bruchion by Aurelian, in 273, cannot have left much
behind of that portion of the splendid library of the Ptolemies which
was kept in the museum. And the other portion of it, which was
kept in the Temple of Serapis, to which latter place it is most probable
the celebrated Pergamese library, presented by Marcus Antonius to
Cleopatra, had also been sent, was totally destroyed in 389, in the
reign of Theodosius I., by a bigoted Christian mob, under the leadership
of the Archbishop Theophilus, a much more ignorant and brutal
zealot than either Omar or Amru.</p>

<p class="pfs70">THE FRANK CONFEDERACY.&mdash;CLOVIS, THE FOUNDER
OF THE FRANK MONARCHY.</p>


<p>A great deal of labor and ingenuity has been wasted in
futile endeavors to trace the origin of a <em>distinct</em> Frank
nation; however, after exhausting every possible means of
research, and every probable and improbable suggestion
of fancy, the most rational writers are now agreed in looking
upon the supposed existence of a distinct <span class="smcap">Frank</span> nation as
a myth,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and in believing that the name of <em>Franks</em> or <em>Freemen</em>
was assumed, most probably about the middle of the
third century after Christ, by a <em>league of several Germanic
nations</em>, of whom the most important were the <span class="smcap">Sigambrians</span>
and the <span class="smcap">Catti</span>. The former constituted, with the <span class="smcap">Bructeri</span>,
the <span class="smcap">Chamavians</span>, the <span class="smcap">Chattuarii</span>, and perhaps also part
of the <span class="smcap">Batavians</span>, the <em>lower</em> branch of the confederacy;
towards the end of the third century their settlements
extended along the eastern bank of the Rhine, from
the Lippe down to the mouth of the great German river;
they occupied also the island of the Batavians, and the
land between the Rhine and Meuse, and down to the
Scheld. From the settlement of the Sigambrians on the
<em>Yssel</em> or <em>Sala</em>, this branch of the confederacy received the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
name of the <em>Salian</em><a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Franks. The <span class="smcap">Catti</span>, the <span class="smcap">Ambsivarians</span>,
and some other tribes, (including perhaps even
the <span class="smcap">Hermunduri</span>, or <span class="smcap">Thuringians</span>?) constituted the
<em>upper</em> branch of the confederacy.</p>

<p>The upper Franks extended their settlements from the
lands between the Mein and Lippe gradually along both
banks of the Rhine, from Mayence to Cologne; and,
although repeatedly driven back by the Romans, they
ultimately retained possession of the left bank of the river;
whence they were also called <em>Riparian</em> or <em>Ripuarian</em> Franks
(from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ripa</i>, bank, shore).</p>

<p>The Franks repeatedly invaded Gaul, more particularly
in the reigns of Valerian<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> (253-260), and of Gallienus
(260-268); and though the Romans boast of numerous
victories achieved at the time against them, under the
leadership of Posthumus, the general of Valerian, but
who afterwards usurped the empire in Gaul,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> yet it is
certain that the Franks not only carried their devastations
from the Rhine to the foot of the Pyrenees, but numbers of
them actually crossed these mountains, and ravaged Spain
during twelve years; when they had exhausted that
unfortunate country, they seized on some vessels in the
ports of Spain, and crossed over to the coast of Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
where their sudden appearance created the utmost consternation.
The Emperor Probus defeated the Franks in 277,
and transported a colony of them to the sea-coast of Pontus,
where he established them with a view of strengthening the
frontier against the inroads of the Alani. But impelled by
their unconquerable love of country and freedom, they
seized on a number of vessels in one of the harbors of the
Euxine, sailed boldly through the Bosphorus and the
Hellespont, and, cruising along the coast of the
Mediterranean, made frequent descents upon the coasts of
Asia, Greece, and Africa, and actually took and sacked the
opulent city of Syracuse, in the island of Sicily; whence
they proceeded to the Columns of Hercules, where they
made their way into the Atlantic, and coasting round Spain
and Gaul, reached the British Channel, sailed through it,
and landed ultimately in safety, and richly laden with spoil,
on the Batavian shore.</p>

<p>In 287, the Menapian <span class="smcap">Carausius</span>, who usurped the imperial
purple in Britain, granted to the Franks the island of the
Batavians, and the land between Meuse and Scheld.
<span class="smcap">Constantius</span> (293), and <span class="smcap">Constantine</span> (313), expelled them
from these provinces; the Ripuarians also felt the heavy
hand of Constantine, and of his son <span class="smcap">Crispus</span>; the latter
expelled them for a time from the left bank of the Rhine.
But Julian found both the Salians and the Ripuarians in
their old places; and, though successful against both (357
and 358), contented himself with the partial expulsion
of the Ripuarians and the Chamavians, leaving the
Sigambrians in quiet possession of the island of the
Batavians, and the extensive district of Brabant, which
they had occupied, on condition that they should henceforth
hold themselves subjects and auxiliaries of the Roman
empire. However, the expelled tribes soon made their
reappearance on the banks of the Rhine, and, at the end of
the fourth century, the Franks had regained complete
possession of their old quarters.</p>

<p>Stilicho, the great minister and general of the contemptible
Honorius, made it one of the first acts of his administration
to secure the alliance of the warlike Franks against
the enemies of Rome (395). He succeeded so well, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
would appear, that the Franks actually handed over to the
discretion of his justice, one of their kings or dukes,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Marcomir, who was accused of having violated the faith of
treaties; the accused prince was exiled to Tuscany, his
brother <span class="smcap">Sunno</span>, who attempted to avenge the insult which
he deemed had been put upon the nation by this
degradation of the dignity of one of its chiefs, met with a
harsher fate at the hands of his own countrymen: he was
slain by them; and the princes whom Stilicho had
appointed, were cheerfully acknowledged. The fact that
Stilicho himself was of German (Vandalian) extraction,
may account in some degree for this extraordinary
subserviency of the Franks to the will and wishes of the
master of the Western Empire. On this occasion, the
Franks had engaged to protect the province of Gaul against
invasion from the side of Germany. An opportunity of
proving their sincerity and fidelity to Rome, or perhaps
rather to the great minister who had made the treaty of
alliance with them, offered in the year 406, when the confederated
nations of the <span class="smcap">Vandals</span>, the <span class="smcap">Alani</span>, the <span class="smcap">Suevi</span>, and
the <span class="smcap">Burgundians</span>, were moving in a body to the Rhine with
the intention of invading Gaul; and most honestly and
valiantly indeed did the Franks acquit themselves of the
duty undertaken by them. It so happened that the Vandals
were the first to make their appearance on the bank of the
river; proudly relying on their numbers they attempted to
force the passage, without awaiting the coming up of the
other confederated nations. They paid the penalty of their
rashness; twenty thousand of them were slain, among
them their king, <span class="smcap">Godigisclus</span>; and the opportune arrival of
the <span class="smcap">Alani</span>, whose squadrons trampled down the infantry of
the Franks, alone saved the nation of the Vandals from
total destruction. Attacked by the combined forces of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
confederates, the Franks were at last compelled to give way.
On the 31st December, 406, the Suevi, the Alani, the
Vandals, and the Burgundians, crossed the frozen Rhine
without further opposition, and thus entered the defenceless
provinces of Gaul, where the Burgundians formed a lasting
settlement, the other nations of the confederacy proceeding
subsequently further on to Spain and Lusitania.</p>

<p>History leaves us in the dark as to the period when the
Franks first submitted to the sway of <em>hereditary</em> princes;
but this much seems certain, that it must have been long
before the time of Pharamond; and also that their long-haired
kings<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> did not derive the name of <em>Merovingians</em>,
from Meroveus, the grandson of Pharamond, but either from
some more ancient Meroveus; or perhaps from <em>Merve</em>, the
name which the Meuse receives after its union with the
Waal (an arm of the Rhine); or from the same name of a
castle near Dortrecht, supposed to have been the family seat
of the Frankian kings.</p>

<p>It would appear that <span class="smcap">Pharamond</span>, the son of Marcomir,
was elevated on the buckler,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> about 410, and that his son
<span class="smcap">Clodion</span> succeeded him in 428. It is somewhat doubtful
whether these two kings held sway over the Ripuarians as
well as over the Salians, or even over all the nations which
constituted the league of the latter. Clodion had his
residence at <em>Dispargum</em> (Duisborch?<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>), in Brabant, somewhere
between Louvain and Brussels. Soon after his
accession, this prince invaded Belgic Gaul, took Tournay
and Cambray, and advanced as far as the river Somme. He
was surprised and defeated in the plains of Artois, by
<span class="smcap">Ætius</span>, the general of the Western empire (430); but
that astute politician deemed it the wiser course to secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the friendship of the powerful leader of the warlike Franks,
and therefore conceded to him free possession of the
conquered province. <em>Clodion</em> died about 448 (450?) He
left two sons who disputed his succession. All we can
gather from the very confused and contradictory accounts of
this period, is that the younger of the two sons, whose
name is not mentioned, was raised on the buckler by the
Ripuarian, the elder, <span class="smcap">Mervey</span> or <span class="smcap">Meroveus</span>,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> by the
Salian Franks; and that the former joined <span class="smcap">Attila</span> in his
invasion of Gaul, and fought on the side of the Huns in the
great battle of Chalons (451); whilst Meroveus, with his
Salians joined the standard of Ætius, and combated on
the side of the Romans and Visigoths. Mervey’s son,
<span class="smcap">Childeric</span>, offended the Franks by his excesses and his
arbitrary proceedings: he was deposed by them, and was
compelled to seek a refuge at the court of the King of the
Thuringians, <span class="smcap">Bisinus</span> or <span class="smcap">Basinus</span>. The Franks having
thus disposed of their king, proceeded to bestow the royal
dignity upon <span class="smcap">Ægidius</span>, the Roman master-general of Gaul,
who, after the compelled abdication and the most suspicious
death of the Emperor <span class="smcap">Majorian</span>, in 461, had refused to
acknowledge the successor forced upon the acceptance of
the Roman Senate by the all-powerful Patrician <span class="smcap">Ricimer</span>,
the instigator of Majorian’s fall, and had assumed the
sovereignty over the <em>remnant</em> of the Gallic province which
still obeyed the Roman sway. However, a few years after,
the Franks, who found the Roman system of taxation more
oppressive and objectionable than any act of Childeric’s,
recalled that prince, and, under his guidance, expelled the
“tax-gatherers” (465). Ægidius acquiesced with a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
grace in a change which he had not the power to oppose.
Childeric had been most hospitably entertained by King
<span class="smcap">Bisinus</span>; but the <em>hospitality</em> extended to him by the wife
of that monarch, Queen <span class="smcap">Basina</span>, was, by all accounts, still
more <em>liberal</em> than that shown to the interesting guest by
her worthy husband. After Childeric’s restoration, Basina
left her husband, and rejoined her lover: the fruit of this
voluntary union was <span class="smcap">Clovis</span>, who, at the age of fifteen,
succeeded, by his father’s death, to the rule of that portion
of the Salian territory, over which Childeric had held sway,
and which was confined to the island of the Batavians, with
the ancient dioceses of Tournay and Arras; for the custom
of the Franks to divide the treasures and territories of a
deceased duke or king equally among his sons, had had the
natural effect to split the kingdom of Pharamond into several
parts independent of each other. <span class="smcap">Clovis</span> combined with an
insatiable ambition, all the qualities requisite to satisfy that
all-absorbing passion. His personal bravery was controlled
and directed by cool and consummate prudence. He wielded
the <em>francisca</em> (the battle-axe of the Franks) with formidable
strength and skill; and he did not hesitate, when occasion
required, to make his own soldiers feel the weight of his
arm and the precision of his aim. He subjected the
barbarians whom he commanded to the strict rules of a
severe discipline which he enforced with unbending rigor.
A crafty and astute politician, he was endowed with the
most essential requisites for success, <em>patience</em> and <em>perseverance</em>.
In the pursuit and accomplishment of his
ambitious designs, he trampled on every law of God and
nature: no feeling of pity ever stayed, no fear of retribution
ever restrained, his murderous hands. He was indeed
the worthy progenitor of a line of princes fit to take the
proudest place among the highest aristocracy of crime, to
put to the blush the <em>Neros</em>, the <em>Caligulas</em>, the <em>Domitians</em>,
the <em>Caracallas</em>, the <em>Elagabalus</em> of imperial Rome, and to
rank with the <em>Bourbons</em>, the <em>Hapsburgs</em> and the <em>Tudors</em>.
At the age of twenty, he made war upon <span class="smcap">Syagrius</span>, the
son of Ægidius, who had inherited from his father the city
and diocese of Soissons, and whose sway was acknowledged
also by the cities and territories of Rheims, Troyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Beauvais and Amiens. In alliance with his cousin
<span class="smcap">Ragnachar</span>, King of the Franks of Cambray, and some
other Merovingian princes, he defeated Syagrius at Soissons,
and reduced in the brief space of a few months the remnant
of the Roman dominion in Gaul, and which had survived
ten years the extinction of the Western empire (486).
Syagrius fled to Thoulouse, where he flattered himself to
find a safe asylum; but in vain: <span class="smcap">Alaric II.</span>, the son of
the great <span class="smcap">Euric</span>, was a minor, and the men who governed
the kingdom of the Visigoths in his name, were but too
readily intimidated by the threats of Clovis, and pusillanimously
delivered up the hapless fugitive to certain death.
A few years after (491), Clovis enlarged his dominions
towards the east by the ample diocese of Tongres. In
498, he married the Burgundian princess <span class="smcap">Clotilda</span>, who,
in the midst of an Arian court, had been educated in the
Nicean faith.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Clotilda’s endeavors to convert her
husband to Christianity were not very successful at first,
though he consented to the baptism of his first-born son;
the sudden death of the infant, which the ignorant and
superstitious Pagan was inclined to attribute to the anger of
his gods, had well-nigh proved fatal to any further attempt
at conversion; still the beauty and blandishments of the
pious queen succeeded at last in overcoming the scruples
and apprehensions of her husband, and gaining his consent
to a repetition of the experiment: this time the infant
survived, and Clovis began to listen with greater favor to
the exhortations of his Christian spouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>In the year 496, the Alemanni,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> who occupied both
banks of the Rhine, from the source of that river to its
conflux with the Mein and the Moselle, and had spread
themselves over the modern provinces of Alsace and
Lorraine, invaded the territories of <span class="smcap">Sigebert</span>, the king of
the Ripuarian Franks, who had his seat at Cologne. Sigebert,
unable to resist the invaders single-handed, invoked
the powerful aid of his cousin, Clovis, and the latter hastened
at once to the rescue. He encountered the invaders in
the plain of <span class="smcap">Tolbiac</span> (<em>Zülpich</em>), about twenty-four miles
from Cologne. A fierce battle ensued. For several hours
it raged with unabated fury, without any decided advantage
being gained by either party; at length the Franks gave
way, and the Alemanni raised shouts of victory. Clovis
saw his dream of power and ambition rapidly fading away;
in his extremity he invoked the God of Clotilda and the
Christians, to grant him the victory over his enemies, which
service he vowed duly to acknowledge, by consenting to be
baptised.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Resolved, however, to do his share also towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the achievement of the victory which he was imploring the
Christian Lord of Hosts to vouchsafe him, he rallied his discomfited
troops, and placing himself at their head, led them
on again to the attack, and by his valor and conduct,
succeeded in restoring the battle. The franciscas, and the
heavy swords of the Franks, made fearful havoc in the
hostile ranks; the king, and many of the most valiant chiefs
of the Alemanni, were slain, and ere evening the power of
one of the fiercest and most warlike nations of Germany,
was annihilated. Pursued by the victorious Franks into
the heart of their forests, the Alemanni were forced to
submit to the yoke of the conqueror; some of their
tribes fled to the territory of the Gothic king of Italy,
<span class="smcap">Theodoric</span>, who assigned them settlements in Rhætia,
and interceded, with his brother-in-law,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in favor of the
conquered nation.</p>

<p>In his distress, Clovis had vowed to adore the God of
the Christians, if He would succour him; the danger past,
and the victory achieved, the perfidious Frank would gladly
have made light of his vow, but for the incessant importunities
of Clotilda, and of Remigius, the Catholic bishop
of Rheims. On the day of Christmas in the same year,
(496), Clovis was baptised in the Cathedral of Rheims with
3000 of his warlike subjects; and the remainder of the
Salians speedily followed the example. As the kings of the
Goths, Burgundians, and Vandals were Arians, and even
the Greek emperor, Anastasius, was not quite free from
the taint of heresy; the Bishop of Rome, <span class="smcap">Anastasius II.</span>,
overjoyed at the conversion of the powerful king of the
Franks to the Nicean faith, hailed the neophyte as the
“<em>Most Christian King</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>The conversion of Clovis to the Catholic faith stood him
in excellent need in his schemes of further aggrandisement.
His arms were henceforward supported by the favor
and zeal of the Catholic clergy, more especially in the
discontented cities of Gaul, under the sway of the Arian
kings of the Visigoths and the Burgundians. The
Armoricans, or Bretons, in the north-western provinces of
Gaul, who had hitherto bravely and successfully resisted all
attempts of the <em>Pagan</em> chief to conquer them, were now
gradually induced to submit to an equal and honorable
union with a Christian people, governed by a <em>Catholic</em> king
(497-500); and the remnants of the Roman troops (most
of them of barbarian extraction), also acknowledged the
sway of Clovis, on condition of their being permitted to
retain their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar dress
and institutions.</p>

<p>Clotilda had never ceased to urge her husband to make
war upon her uncle Gundobald, the murderer of her father.
Her other uncle, <span class="smcap">Godegesil</span>, had been permitted by his
rapacious brother to retain the dependent principality of
Geneva. But fearful lest Gundobald should treat him in
the end the same as he had his other brothers, he lent a
willing ear to the suggestions of his niece, and the tempting
offers of the Frankish king, and entered into a secret
compact with the latter to betray and abandon the cause
of his brother on the first favorable opportunity. Hereupon
Clovis declared war against the King of Burgundy, and
invaded his territories: in the year 500 or 501, the armies
of the Franks and the Burgundians met between Langres
and Dijon. The treacherous desertion, at the decisive
moment, of Godegesil and the troops of Geneva, saved
Clovis from defeat. Apprehensive of the disaffection of the
Gauls, Gundobald abandoned the castle of Dijon, and the
important cities of Lyons and Vienna, to the king of the
Franks, and continued his flight till he had reached
Avignon; but here he made a stand, and defended the city
with such skill and vigor, that Clovis ultimately consented
to a treaty of peace, which made the king of Burgundy
tributary to him, and stipulated the cession of the province
of Vienna to Godegesil, as a reward for his treachery. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
garrison of 5000 Franks was left at Vienna, to secure the
somewhat doubtful allegiance of Godegesil, and also to
protect the latter against the vengeance of his offended
brother. But Gundobald, unscrupulous and truculent
though he was in the pursuit of his grasping policy,
was yet not lacking wisdom. As soon as the conclusion of
the peace with Clovis had restored to him the remnant of
his kingdom, he applied himself to gain the affections of his
Roman and Gallic subjects, by the promulgation of a code of
wise and impartial laws<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> (502), and to conciliate the Catholic
prelates by artful promises of his approaching conversion
from the errors of the Arian heresy. Having strengthened
his position, moreover, by alliances with the kings of the
Ostrogoths and Visigoths, he suddenly invaded the territories
which Clovis had compelled him to cede to his
brother, and surprised Vienna and its Frankish garrison
ere his brother was even fully aware of his hostile intentions.
Godegesil sought refuge in a church; but the
protection of the holy precincts availed him nought; he was
struck down dead at the altar by his remorseless brother.
The provinces of Geneva and Vienna were re-united to the
Burgundian kingdom; the captive Franks were sent to the
king of the Visigoths, who settled them in the territory of
Thoulouse. Clovis, who could now no longer rely upon the
assistance of a traitor in the camp of Gundobald, deemed it
the wiser course to submit to the altered state of affairs,
and to content himself with the alliance and the promised
military service of the King of Burgundy.</p>

<p>Already before the Burgundian war, Clovis had cast his
covetous eyes upon the fair provinces of the south of Gaul,
which were held by <span class="smcap">Alaric II.</span>, the King of the Visigoths.
Here, also, the disaffection of the Catholic Gauls and
Romans promised the best chances of success. Some paltry
border-squabble was eagerly laid hold of by Clovis to pick a
quarrel with the King of the Visigoths, and war seemed at
the time inevitable between the two nations; when Theodoric,
Alaric’s father-in-law,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> interposed his good offices, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
succeeded, by a well-timed threat of an armed intervention,
in restraining the aggressive spirit of the Frankish King,
(498). A personal interview was proposed between Clovis
and Alaric: it was held on the border of the two states, in
a small island of the Loire, near Amboise. The two kings
met in right royal fashion: they embraced, feasted together,
indulged in a profusion of protestations of mutual regard
and brotherly affection, and parted full of smiles&mdash;and
mutual hatred and distrust.</p>

<p>Had Alaric pursued the same wise course as Gundobald,
he might have found in the affection of the people under his
sway, a safe shield against Frank aggression. But, unfortunately,
the Arian could not forbear from inflicting upon
his dissenting subjects, those petty acts of tyranny in which
dominant sects delight, and which are always sure to create
a deeper and more lasting disaffection than any act of political
oppression. The Catholic clergy in Aquitaine laid their
complaints against their Arian sovereign, before the Catholic
King of the Franks; and besought the latter to come to the
aid of his co-religionists, and free them from the yoke of
their Gothic tyrants. Clovis eagerly seized the pretext.
In a general assembly of the Frankish chiefs and the
Catholic prelates held at Paris, he declared his intention not
to permit the Arian heretics to retain possession any longer
of the fairest portion of Gaul. Alaric did his best to prepare
for the coming struggle; the army which he collected was
much more numerous, indeed, than the military power which
Clovis could bring against him; but, unfortunately, a long
peace had enervated the descendants of the once so formidable
warriors of the first Alaric. They were unable to
sustain the fierce shock of the Franks, who totally overthrew
and routed them in the battle of Vouglé, near Poitiers, in
507. Alaric himself fell by the hand of his rival; Angoulême,
Bordeaux, Thoulouse, submitted to the conqueror, and the
whole of Aquitaine acknowledged his sway, (508); and he
would have succeeded in driving the Visigoths beyond the
Pyrenean mountains, had not the King of Italy thrown the
shield of his power over the discomfited nation. The Franks
and their Burgundian allies were besieging Arles and
Carcassone, when the valiant <span class="smcap">Hibbas</span>, Theodoric’s general,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
appeared on the scene with a powerful and well-appointed
army of Ostrogoths. He defeated the victors of Vouglé,
and compelled the ambitious King of the Franks to raise
the siege of the two cities, and to lend a willing ear to
proposals of an advantageous peace. He then overthrew
and slew the bastard <span class="smcap">Gesalic</span>, who had usurped the throne
of the Visigoths, to the exclusion of Alaric’s infant son,
<span class="smcap">Amalaric</span>. The latter was now proclaimed King of Spain
and Septimania, under the guardianship of his grandfather,
Theodoric: Clovis being permitted to retain possession of
the land from the Cevennes and the Garonne to the Loire,
whilst the Provence was annexed to the dominions of the
King of Italy, who thus did not disdain despoiling his own
grandson of one of the finest provinces of his kingdom.</p>

<p>The Emperor Anastasius, overjoyed at the humiliation
inflicted by Clovis upon the Goths, bestowed upon the King
of the Franks the dignity and ensigns of the Roman consulship!
(510); which, though in reality a mere empty title,
yet invested that monarch, in the eyes of his Roman and
Gallic subjects, with the prestige of Imperial authority.</p>

<p>Clovis seeing himself thus in undisputed possession of the
greater part of Gaul, thought the time had come to unite the
several Frankish tribes into one nation, under his sceptre.
But, knowing full well that his Franks would not follow
him in an open war against his own kindred of the race of
Pharamond, he coolly planned the assassination of the
whole family. <span class="smcap">Sigebert</span>, the king of the Ripuarians, had
proved himself a most faithful ally of his Salian cousin;
and in the last campaign against the Visigoths, he had sent
to his aid a powerful contingent of his Ripuarians, under
the command of his own son, <span class="smcap">Chloderic</span>. Clovis excited
the ambition and cupidity of the latter, and succeeded in
persuading him to murder his own father; when the horrid
deed was perpetrated, the wretched son, intent upon
securing the powerful support of the Salian king, offered
him part of the treasures of the murdered man. The “fair
cousin” sent him word to keep his treasures, and simply to
show them to his ambassadors, that he, Clovis, might rejoice
in the prosperity of his cousin; but, when the assassin of
his father had lifted up the heavy lid of one of the boxes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
and was bending down to take out some of the precious
articles which it held, he was slain in his turn by one of
the <em>ambassadors</em> of Clovis. That most Christian king
afterwards solemnly protested to the Ripuarians that
Chloderic, the assassin of his father, had fallen by the hand
of some unknown avenger, and that he, Clovis, was innocent
of the death of either of them. “Surely,” he exclaimed,
with well affected horror and indignation, “no one would
dare to deem <em>me</em> guilty of that most horrible of all crimes,
the murder of my own kindred!” The Ripuarians believed
him, and acknowledged him their king, by raising him on a
shield. The next victims were <span class="smcap">Chararic</span>, the king of the
Morinic Franks, in Belgium, and his son. Chararic, had
refused his aid to Clovis, in the campaign against Syagrius;
the fact had, indeed, occurred rather long ago, but still it
answered the purpose of the unscrupulous son of Childeric.
Chararic and his son, having fallen into his hands by the
grossest treachery, were despoiled of their treasures and
their long hair, and ordained priests. When the son,
endeavoring to console his father, could not refrain from
indignant invectives against the author of their misery, the
pious king of the Salians calmly ordered both of them to
be slain, as they had “dared to rebel against the will of the
Most High!” There remained still the family of the
Cambray princes, consisting of three brothers, viz.,
<span class="smcap">Ragnachar</span>, <span class="smcap">Richar</span>, and <span class="smcap">Rignomer</span>. The pretext in
their case was that they still continued Pagans. Clovis
bribed some of the chiefs of the tribe with <em>spurious</em> gold;
they fell unawares upon Ragnachar and Richar, bound
them, and delivered them into the hands of their “loving
cousin.” Addressing the hapless Ragnachar, that monstrous
villain exclaimed, “How dare you bring disgrace upon our
noble family, by submitting to the indignity of bonds!”
and, with a blow of his battle-axe, he spared the wretched
captive the trouble of a reply; then turning to the brother
of the butchered man, “Hadst thou defended thy brother,”
he cried, “they could not have bound him;” and an instant
after, the blood and brains of the brothers had mingled their
kindred streams on the weapon of the most Christian king.
When the wretches who had betrayed their princes into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
hands, of the assassin, came to complain that the price of
their treachery had been paid in <em>base coin</em>, he told them,
traitors deserved no better reward, and bade them be gone,
lest he should feel tempted to avenge upon them the blood
of his murdered relations.</p>

<p>Rignomer was disposed of by private assassination, and
Clovis might now exclaim: “At last I am king of the
Franks.” The worthy bishop of Tours, the chronicler of
this, and some of the following reigns of the Merovingians,
whilst coolly relating these horrid crimes of his hero,
piously informs us that success in all his undertakings
was vouchsafed to Clovis by the Most High, and that his
enemies were delivered up into his hands, <em>because he walked
with a sincere heart in the ways of the Lord, and did that
which was right in his sight</em>!!<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> What a pity that this
godly monarch was not permitted to walk a little longer in
the ways of the Lord: an additional score or so of murders
would surely have achieved canonisation for him. But the
most orthodox and most Christian king was suddenly called
away from the scene of his glorious exploits; at the very
time when he was revolving mighty schemes of further
aggrandisement, and planning, as preliminary step, the
assassination of Gundobald, the king of Burgundy, and of
Theudes, the regent of Spain, (511). His four sons divided
his kingdom between them; <span class="smcap">Theodoric</span>, (Thierry) the eldest,
received the Eastern part, <em>Austrasia</em>,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> (Francia orientalis),
and also part of Champagne, and the conquests of Clovis
south of the Loire; he established the seat of his government
at Metz; <ins class="corr" id="tn-104" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Chlodomir’s seat'">
<span class="smcap">Clodomir’s</span> seat</ins> was at Orleans; <span class="smcap">Clotaire’s</span>
at Soissons; <span class="smcap">Childebert’s</span> at Paris; the share of the latter
was called <em>Neustria</em> or <em>Neustrasia</em> (Francia occidentalis), a
name which was afterwards used to designate the whole of
the territories occupied by the Franks between the mouths
of the Rhine and the Loire, the Meuse, and the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>It is not my intention to smear my pages with the blood
and mire of the lives and acts of the Merovingian princes.
We will content ourselves here with a brief glance at the
principal events and incidents connected with the progress
of the Frank empire during the two hundred years that
intervene between the death of Clovis and the accession of
Charles, afterwards surnamed <em>Martel</em>, as Mayor of the
Palace.</p>

<p>In the year 523, the three sons of Clotilda, invited by
their unforgiving mother, invaded Burgundy, and attacked
the son and successor of Gundobald, <span class="smcap">Sigismond</span>, whose
conversion to the Catholic faith has gained him, in the
lying annals penned by the clerical historians of the period,
the name of a saint and a martyr, though he had imbrued
his hands in the blood of his own son, an innocent youth
whom he had basely sacrificed to the pride of his second
wife! Sigismond lost a battle and fell soon after into the
hands of the sons of Clotilda, who carried him to Orleans,
and had him buried alive together with his wife and two of
his children&mdash;an excellent proof that they had not <em>degenerated</em>.
Sigismond’s brother, <span class="smcap">Gondemar</span>, defeated the
invaders in the battle of Vienna, where Clodomir fell. This
gave Gondemar a few years’ respite, as the two brothers,
Clotaire and Childebert, were busy sharing the inheritance
of Clodomir.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> But, in 534, the brothers invaded Burgundy
again; when Gondemar lost his crown and his liberty, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the fair Burgundian provinces became the patrimony of the
Merovingian princes. In the year 530, Theodoric and
Clotaire conquered and annexed the territories of the
Thuringians, thus extending their dominion to the banks of
the Unstrut. Rhætia and Provence also fell into the hands
of the successors of Clovis. Theudobald, the grandson and
second successor of Theodoric, or Thierry, died in 554; as
he left no heir, Clotaire and Childebert shared his dominions
between them; Childebert’s death, in 558, without male
heirs, left Clotaire in sole and undisputed possession of the
Frankish empire, which now extended from the Atlantic
and the Pyrenees to the Unstrut. After having added to
the list of his crimes the murder of his son Chramus, and
also of the wife and the two daughters of the latter, King
Clotaire died in 560. His kingdom was again divided
between his four sons, <span class="smcap">Charibert</span>, <span class="smcap">Guntram</span>, <span class="smcap">Sigebert</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Chilperic</span>; the eldest of the brothers, Charibert, died
in 567. As he left no heir, his territories were divided
between the three surviving brothers. But Chilperic was
dissatisfied with his share, and this led to a series of civil
wars, which terminated only in 613, when Clotaire II., the
son of Chilperic and Fredegonda, re-united in his hands
the entire empire of the Franks.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to crowd a greater number of
more appalling and atrocious crimes, within the short
space of half a century, than were committed by the
Merovingians, from the time of the death of Charibert up
to the re-union of the empire under Clotaire II.; the
names of Chilperic, of Fredegonda,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of Brunehilda,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Theuderic,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and last, though not least, of the monster
Clotaire (second of the name) deserve, indeed, prominent
places in the great criminal calendar of the world’s history.</p>

Godemar; the latter committed suicide; the former was put to death by
his inhuman brother Gundobald, and his wife and his two sons shared
his fate; his two daughters were spared, and one of them, Clotilda, was
brought up at the court of Lyons; and, as chance would have it, in
the <em>Catholic</em> faith, though Gundobald himself, like most of the Christian
princes of the time, professed the Arian doctrine, Gundobald would
gladly have refused Clovis the hand of his niece, had he dared to brave
the anger of the powerful Frankish chief. Clotilda, on her part, was
overjoyed at the prospect of an alliance with a King, whose ambition
might be turned to good account for the pursuit of her own vengeful
projects against the murderer of her father; with a pagan, whose
conversion to the Nicean creed would gain her beloved Catholic church
a formidable champion against the hated Arian heretics. Gundobald
had scarcely parted with his niece, and her father’s treasures, when the
pious princess displayed her Christian spirit, by ordering her Frankish
escort to burn down the Burgundian villages through which they were
passing, and when she saw the flames rising, and heard the despairing

upon her. And all these people <em>professed</em> the religion of Christ, and were

<p class="pfs70">DECLINE OF THE MEROVINGIAN PRINCES.&mdash;THE MAYORS
OF THE PALACE.&mdash;PEPIN OF LANDEN.&mdash;PEPIN OF HERISTAL.&mdash;CHARLES
MARTEL.&mdash;THE BATTLE OF TOURS.</p>


<p>When the Roman empire had ceased to exist, the
Frankish kings had, in imitation of the Roman rulers,
begun to surround themselves with a court, and a great
many high officers, and charges had been created, among
the most important of which may be mentioned the office
of Lord High Chancellor (archicancellarius, referendarius);
Lord High Chamberlain, or High Treasurer (thesaurarius,
camerarius); Master of the royal stables (marescalchus);
Lord Justice (comes palatii); Steward of the royal
household (senescalchus); and more particularly that of
Mayor of the palace (præfectus palatii, or major-domus,
or comes domûs regiæ). The functions of the latter officer
had originally been confined to the general superintendence
of the palace, and the administration of the royal domains;
but had speedily been extended also to the command of the
household troops. In the course of the domestic wars
between the Merovingian princes, the mayors of the palace
had gradually acquired a power and influence second only
to that of the king; so that, after the assassination of
Sigebert, in 575, <span class="smcap">Gogo</span>, the then mayor of the palace of
Austrasia, had actually been named regent during the
minority of Sigebert’s son, Childebert. So powerful indeed
had these domestic officers grown, that Clotaire II. was
positively forced to bind himself by oath to <span class="smcap">Warnachar</span>,
the mayor of the palace of Burgundy, to leave him for his
life in undisturbed possession of his office; he was obliged
also to acknowledge the learned and valiant <span class="smcap">Arnulf</span>, the
Austrasian, mayor of the palace, and subsequently&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
that officer embraced the ecclesiastical profession, and became
Bishop of Metz&mdash;the energetic Pepin of Landen,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> as his
representative with sovereign powers in Austrasia. Even
when Clotaire had ceded the kingdom of Austrasia to his son
<span class="smcap">Dagobert</span> (622), Pepin continued to exercise almost unlimited
sway in that part of the Frankish empire. After
Clotaire’s death, in 623, Dagobert succeeded also to the
Neustrian kingdom; and in 631, after his brother Charibert’s
death,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> who had held some of the south-western provinces, he
became sole king of France. He died in 638; he was a compound
of sensuality and indolence; still his character and life
were not stained with the horrible crimes perpetrated by his
predecessors, and more particularly by his own father; he
was the last of the descendants of Clovis, who exhibited
even the faintest spark of that fierce and energetic spirit
which made the founder of the Frank monarchy, however
so abhorrent as a <em>man</em>, yet <em>respectable</em>, and even <em>great</em>, as a
<em>king</em>. Dagobert built and richly endowed the Church of
St. Denys, which gained him the surname “The Great,”
from a grateful clergy; but history has refused to register
the ill-deserved epithet. Pepin of Landen died a year after
his king (689). His son, <em>Grimoald</em>, deemed the power of
his family already so firmly established, that, taking advantage
of the tender age of Dagobert’s sons, Sigebert (second
of the name in the list of the Merovingian kings), and Clovis
(II.), he attempted to deprive them of their father’s
succession, and to place his own son (Childebert) on the
throne; both father and son paid with their lives the failure
of the ambitious plan. But the overthrow of Grimoald
led simply to a change of persons; the power of the mayors
of the palace remained undiminished, and from this time
forward, the Merovingian kings were mere ciphers. “They
ascended the throne without power, and sunk into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
grave without a name.” (Gibbon.) Sigebert died in 650;
his brother Clovis six years after. One of the sons of the
latter, Clotaire (III.), succeeded to the Neustrian, another,
Childeric (II.), to the Austrasian part of the empire. After
Clotaire’s death, in 670, the third brother, Theodoric, or
Thierry (III.), was for a short time king of Neustria; but
he was speedily dispossessed by his brother Childeric (or
to speak more correctly, <em>his</em> mayor of the palace was
compelled to give way to Childeric’s mayor of the palace).
Childeric was murdered in 673; when Thierry was reinstated
in Neustria, Austrasia being given to Dagobert
(II.), a son of Sigebert II., but who had hitherto been
kept out of his inheritance.</p>

<p>After the death of Dagobert in 678, the Austrasians
refused to submit to Thierry, the King of Neustria and
Burgundy, or rather to his haughty mayor of the palace,
<span class="smcap">Ebroin</span>. <span class="smcap">Pepin d’Heristal</span>, the grandson of Pepin of
Landen, and his cousin, <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, were at the head of the
insurgent Austrasian nobility. Martin fell into the hands
of Ebroin, and was killed. Ebroin himself was soon after
assassinated, (682). His successor, <span class="smcap">Giselmar</span>, defeated
Pepin at Namur, but the Austrasian notwithstanding maintained
his position. The Neustrian nobility, discontented
with the rule of Giselmar’s successor, <span class="smcap">Berthar</span> or <span class="smcap">Berchar</span>,
ultimately called Pepin to their aid.</p>

<p>Berthar, and his puppet, Thierry, were defeated by the
Austrasian ruler in the famous battle of Testry, near Peronne
and St. Quentin, in 687. Berthar was slain as he fled
from the field of battle: and although the <em>name</em> of king was
left to Thierry, he was compelled to acknowledge Pepin as
<em>sole</em>, <em>perpetual</em>, and <em>hereditary</em> Mayor of the Palace, in the
three kingdoms of Neustria, Austrasia, and Burgundy,
under the style and title of Duke and Prince of the Franks,
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dux et Princeps Francorum</span>). Pepin was now, to all
intents and purposes, the actual ruler of the Frankish
empire&mdash;king in all but the name. The nominal sovereigns
had, henceforth, a residence<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> assigned them, which they dared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
not even quit without the sanction of their master; nay, even
the paltry consolation of the pomp and glitter of royalty was
not vouchsafed them&mdash;except once a year in the month of
March,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> when the royal puppet was conducted in state in
the old Frankish fashion, in a waggon drawn by two oxen,
to the great annual assembly of the nation; to give audience
to foreign ambassadors, or to receive plaints and petitions&mdash;and
to place his organ of speech, for a time, at the disposal
of the Mayor of the Palace, and give utterance to the replies
or decisions of the real ruler of France.
<a id="maltese"></a> The assembly over,
the “King” was reconducted to his residence or prison,
where a feeble retinue and a strong guard insulted the fallen
majesty of the house of Clovis. It would even appear, that
the civil list assigned to the “King,” was only a precarious
grant, and that the nominal master of three kingdoms, was
often left without the means of defraying the expenses of
his <em>humble</em> household.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The epithet of the “<em>do-nothing
kings</em>,” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les rois fainéans</span>) has been felicitously applied to
the last princes of the Merovingian line. Besides Thierry
III, (✠621), three of them lived in the reign of Pepin of
Heristal, viz: Clovis III, (✠695); Childebert III,
(✠711); and Dagobert III., all of them minors.</p>

<p>Pepin was an able and energetic ruler; he restored in some
measure the respect of the law. Liberal rewards secured
him the allegiance of the nobility; munificent endowments
to churches and monasteries, and the aid and encouragement
which he gave to the Christian missionaries, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
endeavoring to convert the heathen Germans, gained him
the favor and support of the clergy: his good sword put
down the discontented; and last, though certainly not least,
he deserved the grateful affection of the people by alleviating
their burthens, and by protecting them, in some measure,
against the despotic oppression of the nobility. The expulsion
of some Christian missionaries from Friesland, gave
Pepin a pretext for endeavoring to subject the Frisons to
the Frankish sway. He invaded Friesland in 689, and
defeated the Frison duke, or prince, Radbodus, at Dorestadt,
or Dorsted; in consequence of which defeat, the latter was
compelled to cede West Friesland to the Duke of the Franks;
but all attempts to obtain the conversion of Radbodus<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> to
Christianity failed.</p>

<p>In 697, a new war broke out between the Duke of the
Franks and the Prince of the Frisons,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in which the latter
is stated to have been again defeated, and compelled to
acknowledge, by the payment of an annual tribute, the
supremacy of the Franks. It is added, also, that he gave
his daughter in marriage to Pepin’s son Grimoald.</p>

<p>Pepin of Heristal made also several expeditions, though,
it would appear, with indifferent success only, against the
Alemanni, the Thuringians, and the Bojoarii, or Bavarians,
who had taken advantage of the internal dissensions and
disorder of the Frankish empire, to shake off the yoke of
their masters.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 714, Pepin fell seriously ill,
at his estate Jopila, on the Meuse. He sent for his only
surviving (legitimate) son, <span class="smcap">Grimoald</span>, whom he had made
(after the death of his friend Nordbert) major domûs in
Neustria, and (after the death of <span class="smcap">Drogo</span>, another of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
sons) Duke of Burgundy and Champagne, and whom he
intended to name his successor in the government of the
entire monarchy. But on his way to his father, Grimoald was
assassinated at Liège, in the church of St. Lambert, by
a Frison; at the instigation, it would appear, of some
discontented nobles. He left an illegitimate infant son,
Theudoald, or Theudebaud. Pepin was unfortunately
persuaded by his wife, the ambitious <span class="smcap">Plectrudis</span><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, who
expected to wield the government during the minority of
her little grandson, to name this infant his successor,
instead of either of his own two illegitimate sons (Charles
and Childebrand)<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, and of whom the latter, more especially,
possessed his father’s great qualities, and that amount of
physical and intellectual vigor indispensable to keep
together and to rule over an empire composed of such
heterogeneous and antagonistic elements, as the Frankish.
Soon after this fatal step, which, we may safely assume
the love of his country and of his glory, would never have
permitted the aged ruler to take, had not his faculties been
greatly impaired at the time by long illness and by the
bitter grief of his son’s death, Pepin of Heristal died on
the 16th of December, 714.</p>

<p>He had scarcely departed life when Plectrudis, who
dreaded the aspiring genius of Charles, had the latter seized,
and confined in the city of Cologne. She now deemed herself
in safe possession of the government; but she was soon
awakened from her ambitious dream. The Neustrians were
indignant that they should thus be handed over to the sway
of a child and to the rule of a woman: they could bear
<em>infant-kings</em>, indeed, but they refused to put up with
an <em>infant mayor of the palace</em>. They, therefore, made
<span class="smcap">Raganfried</span>, a powerful Neustrian noble, their mayor of
the palace, and prepared to resist by force of arms, any
attempt which Plectrudis might make to compel their
submission. The widow of Pepin showed indeed that, if
she had had the ambition to seize the sceptre, she had also
the spirit to wield, and the requisite energy to defend it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
She collected a powerful army, and sent the puppet-King
Dagobert (III.), and his infant minister Theudebaud, with
it against, what she was pleased to call, the Neustrian
rebels. But the fortune of war declared against her: the
Austrasian forces were totally routed by Raganfried, and
“King” Dagobert fell into the hands of the Neustrian
mayor of the palace. The infant on whose tiny shoulders
Pepin’s ill-judged partiality, or uxoriousness, had thrown
the burthen of three kingdoms, died soon after this
reverse (715). Radbodus took advantage of the position of
affairs, to re-annex West Friesland to his dominions; and,
in conjunction with the Saxons, invaded the Frankish territories
from the north east, whilst the Merovingian princes
of Aquitaine ravaged them in the south west; the
Alemanni and the Bavarians threw off the Frankish yoke,
and resumed their ancient independence. Matters were
looking dark indeed for the house of the Pepins, and
though Mistress Plectrudis most gallantly braved the
storm, her utmost efforts could have availed but little
against such a multitude of foes, had not Pepin’s son,
Charles, meanwhile found his way out of the prison to
which the ambition of his father’s widow had confined
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span>, who was destined afterwards to play so important
a part in history, was, at this time, about 25 years
of age (he was born in 690). Nature had been most
bountiful to him: tall even among the tall nation of the
Franks, of a most commanding figure, and of a compact and
beautifully symmetrical frame, he might be said to present
in his physical conformation a compound of Hercules and
Antinöus; his features were regular and expressive, and the
lightning glance of his large blue eyes reflected, as in a
mirror, the energy of his mind and the vigor of his
intellect. He possessed enormous bodily strength combined
with surprising agility. The remembrance of his great
father, and his own manly beauty and grace, gained him the
hearts of the Austrasians; and he soon found himself at
the head of a formidable body of troops, with which he
proceeded first to attack the Frisons, but with rather
indifferent success, it would appear, as, we find Radbodus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
and his Frisons soon after laying siege to Cologne,
in conjunction with the Neustrians under Raganfried.
Plectrudis, however, purchased the retreat of the besieging
forces; and the Frisons and Neustrians having separated
again, Charles fell upon the latter at Ambleva. But,
although he exhibited all the qualities of a great general,
and that the fearful execution which his heavy sword did
in the hostile ranks struck terror into the foe, and made
ever after his war-cry “Here Charles and his sword,” ring
as the prelude of inevitable defeat on the affrighted ears of
his enemies: yet the superiority of numbers was too
great on the side of Raganfried, and the battle terminated
at last rather in favor of the Neustrians than otherwise
(716). Soon after his capture by the Neustrians, Dagobert
had passed from his royal prison to the grave (715), and
another unlucky scion of the race of Pharamond, the Monk
Daniel, had been dragged from the repose of his cloistral
cell, to figure, as Chilperic II., in the line of the “titular”
kings of France. Charles would have acquiesced in the
arrangement, had not Raganfried steadily refused to
acknowledge him as Duke of Austrasia; he determined,
therefore, to appeal once more to the decision of arms. A
fierce and sanguinary battle was fought between the
Austrasians and the Neustrians, at Vincy, between Arras
and Cambray (21st of March, 717): and this time, Charles’
valor and generalship were rewarded with a brilliant and
decisive victory, which made him master of the country up
to Paris. But, wisely declining to pursue his conquests in
this quarter, and to court perhaps the chance of a defeat far
away from his resources, he led his victorious army swiftly
back to the Rhine, and compelled Plectrudis to give up to
him the city of Cologne, and his paternal treasures; which
latter he turned to excellent account in increasing the
number and efficiency of his forces. Plectrudis took refuge
in Bavaria.</p>

<p>Though the Merovingian princes had lost all real power
in the state, yet there still attached to the name of the
family a prestige in the eyes of the nation, which rendered
the continued existence of “Kings” chosen from among the
descendants of Clovis, a matter of political necessity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Charles wisely resolved therefore, to put himself in this
respect on equal terms with Raganfried; and he accordingly
invested with the insignia of a sham royalty another scion
of the long-haired line, yclept Clotaire, fourth of that name.
An expedition against the Saxons, to chastise them for
their predatory incursions into the Frankish territories, was
eminently successful, and the son of Pepin displayed his
victorious banner on the Weser (718); but receiving information
that Raganfried had made an alliance against him
with the valiant <span class="smcap">Eudes</span>, Duke of Aquitaine (of Merovingian
descent), and dreading lest the united power of the two
might prove too strong for him, he resolved to attack
the former before a junction of the allied forces could be
effected, and accordingly led his army with his accustomed
celerity from the banks of the Weser to the banks of the
Seine. After totally routing Raganfried at Soissons (719),
he compelled Paris to surrender. The wretched Chilperic<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
sought refuge with his ally, Eudes. Charles marched on to
the Loire, and was preparing to carry his arms into
Aquitaine, when the death of Clotaire led to an arrangement
with Chilperic, who, acknowledging Charles as major domûs
in the three kingdoms, was permitted to continue in the
enjoyment of his fictitious royalty. In the same year still
(719), Charles was delivered by death from another of his
opponents, Radbodus, the brave duke of the Frisons.
He promptly took advantage of this event to re-annex
West Friesland to the Frankish dependencies, and to induct
Bishop Willibrod into his see of Utrecht, from which
Radbodus had kept him excluded.</p>

<p>In the year 720, Chilperic was gathered to his fathers;
Charles replaced him by a child of the Merovingian race,
taken from the monastery of Lala (Thierry IV.) In 721
Charles crossed the Rhine at the head of a powerful
army, to subject the Alemanni, the Bavarians, and the
Thuringians again to the Frankish sway. As he saw in the
conversion of these stubborn nations to Christianity one
of the most efficient means to secure their allegiance in
future, he had himself attended by Winifried,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
missionaries, who, now that they were supported by the
arms of the Frankish chief, were brilliantly successful in
their missionary labors, in some of the very places among
others, where they had on former occasions been treated
with derision and contumely, or whence they had been
forcibly expelled.</p>

<p>In 722, Charles drove the Saxons from the Hassian
(Hessian) district which they had invaded; but when he
followed them into their own country, with the intention of
subjecting them altogether to his sway, he experienced such
determined resistance that he wisely resolved to leave them
alone. In 725, he compelled the Suabians and Alemanni,
and their duke, <span class="smcap">Lantfried</span>, to acknowledge his sovereignty.</p>

<p>Since 553, after the extinction of the Gothic kingdom of
Italy, the Agilolfingian dukes of Bavaria “enjoyed” the
“protection”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> of the Frankish kings; although, whenever
the dissensions among the members of that amiable
family, or the contentions among the mayors of the palace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
afforded a fitting opportunity, the Bavarians invariably took
occasion to “thank” them for their protection, and to
decline further favors. But the persuasive force of Pepin
of Heristal, and of his son Charles, fully succeeded in the
end in restoring the amicable relations between the two
nations, to the old footing. Duke Theodo II., a most pious
prince, who greatly favored and furthered the extension of
Christianity in his dominions, committed the capital blunder
so common at the time (and so natural withal)&mdash;to divide his
dominions between his three sons, Theodoald (Theudebaud),
Theudebert, and Grimoald. Theudebaud had married Pilitrudis,
the fair daughter of Plectrudis; he died in 716, and
his brother Grimoald deemed it no harm to marry the
beautiful widow of the departed; but Saint Corbinian
happened to think very differently; and his zealous exhortations,
and the fearful picture which he drew of the pains
and penalties that awaited him who should have committed,
what the holy man was pleased to call, “incest,”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> frightened
poor Duke Grimoald into giving his consent to a divorce from
his dearly beloved wife. Mistress Pilitrudis, however, was
by no means pleased with the pusillanimous conduct of her
second husband; and the exile of the meddlesome ecclesiastic
speedily showed him, that a woman offended may prove
more than a match <em>even</em> for a priest and a saint. Theudebert
also died (724), leaving behind a son, named <span class="smcap">Hugibert</span>,
and a daughter, named <span class="smcap">Guntrudis</span>, and who was married
to <span class="smcap">Liutprand</span>, King of the Lombards. After his second
brother’s death, Grimoald seized upon his dominions to the
prejudice of his nephew. Hugibert, finding all his remonstrances
disregarded, claimed the intercession of the Duke
of the Franks, in his capacity as Protector of Bavaria.
Charles accepted the offer of mediator between the contending
parties; and called upon Grimoald to deliver up to
Hugibert the provinces which he was unjustly withholding
from him. Grimoald refusing, Charles entered Bavaria
at the head of his army, and the Bavarian duke was
defeated and slain in the first battle (725). Hugibert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
now succeeded to the government of all Bavaria,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> with
the exception, however, of a large slice of the Northern
provinces, which he ceded to Charles in reward of his
services.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The unfortunate Pilitrudis was despoiled by the
“magnanimous” victor of all she possessed, except a mule,
or donkey, to carry her to Pavia to her relations. A new
irruption of the Saxons, called Charles again to the Weser;
he defeated and drove back the invaders (729). Whilst he
was thus occupied on the Saxon frontier, the Suabians and
Alemanni took advantage of his absence, to throw off once
more the yoke of the Franks. Charles confounded them,
however, by the rapidity of his movements; he appeared on
the Mein before they were well aware that he had left the
banks of the Weser. The battle which ensued, terminated
in the total defeat of the “rebels;” Duke Lantfried was
slain, and the humbled nation submitted to the rule of the
conqueror (730).</p>

<p>We are now approaching the most important and most
interesting period in the life and career of Charles, viz., his
encounter with the Saracens; we will, therefore, resume
here the thread of the history of the Moslem invasion,
broken off at <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>, where we left the Saracen general, El
Zama, laying siege to Thoulouse. A branch of the Merovingian
family, descended from Clotaire’s (II.) younger son
Charibert (631), had established the independent<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> duchy of
Aquitaine in the south of France. At the time of the Arab
invasion, <span class="smcap">Eudes</span> (Eudo, or Odo), an able and energetic
prince, was Duke of Aquitaine. This prince, seeing his
capital threatened by the Moslems, collected a numerous
army of Gascons, Goths, and Franks, and marched bravely
to the rescue. He attacked the Arabs under the walls of
Thoulouse, and succeeded in inflicting on them a most
disastrous defeat (721). El Zama fell in the battle, and the
discomfited Moslems were saved from total destruction
only by the prudence and valor of <span class="smcap">Abdalrahman Ben
Abdallah</span> (Abderrahman, or Abderame), a veteran officer,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
whom they had elected by acclamation in the place of their
late general.</p>

<p>The Khalif, however, did not ratify the choice of the
army, but named <span class="smcap">Anbesa</span> to the government of Spain.
The new governor advanced again into Aquitaine in 725; he
took Carcassone by storm, and penetrated as far as Burgundy;
but the valiant Eudes succeeded ultimately in driving him
back, and also in defeating several subsequent attempts of the
Arabs to gain possession of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>In the year 730, the Khalif Hesham, yielding to the
wishes of the people and the army of Spain, restored
Abdalrahman to the government of that part of the Arab
dominions. That daring and ambitious commander proposed
to subject to his sway, not only Aquitaine, but the entire
Frank empire; and collected a formidable host to carry his
resolve into execution. But, at the very threshold of his
enterprise, he met with an obstacle which, though he indeed
triumphantly overcame it, yet cannot be denied to have
exercised a powerful adverse influence upon its final issue.
This was the rebellion of <span class="smcap">Othman</span>, or <span class="smcap">Munuza</span>, a Moorish
chief, who, as governor of Cerdagne, held the most important
passes of the Pyrenees. The fortune of war had placed the
beauteous daughter of Eudes in the hands of Munuza; and
the political Duke of Aquitaine, justly appreciating the
advantages of an alliance with the man who might be said
to hold the keys of his house, had willingly consented to
accept the African misbeliever for his son-in-law. The
skill, rapidity, and decision, of Abdalrahman’s movements
undoubtedly disconcerted the strategic combinations of the
two allies, and Munuza was overcome and slain, ere Eudes
could hasten to his assistance; the head of the rebel,
and the daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine, were sent to
Damascus. But much precious time was consumed, and a
great number of combatants were lost, in this unexpected
prelude to the invasion of France. However, immediately
after the overthrow of Munuza, Abdalrahman advanced
rapidly to the Rhone, crossed that river, and laid siege to
Arles; Eudes attempted to relieve the beleaguered city, but
his army was totally routed, and Arles fell into the hands of
the invaders (731). Abdalrahman speedily conquered the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
greater part of Aquitaine, and advanced to Bordeaux. The
intrepid Eudes met him once more, at the head of a numerous
army; but neither the valor and skill of the Christian leader
nor the bravery of his troops could save them from a most
disastrous defeat. Bordeaux fell, and the Saracens overran
the fairest provinces of France (732). Charles, who would
most probably have remained deaf to the most urgent
entreaties of Eudes, whom he regarded in the light of a
rival, comprehended the necessity of a speedy and vigorous
action, from the moment that he saw his own dominions
threatened. He, therefore, rapidly collected his faithful
Austrasians and the auxiliary contingents of the Alemanni,
the Thuringians, and the Bavarians; and ordered the
Neustrian and Burgundian nobles to join him with their
followers; and although many of the <em>Burgundian</em> nobles
hung back, yet a most powerful host of the nations of
Germany and Gaul gathered under the banner of the
Christian leader, who was joined also by Eudes and the
remains of the Aquitanian army. In the centre of France,
between Tours and Poitiers, the Franks and the Moslems
met, in the month of October, 732. Six days were spent in
desultory warfare, and many a gallant heart had ceased to
beat, ere as the red sun of the seventh day rose, the day on
which it was to be decided whether mosque or cathedral
should prevail in Europe. The battle raged fiercely from
noon till eventide; the fiery sons of the South fought
with tenfold their accustomed valor, and Abdalrahman
emulated the glory of Kaled “the Sword of God.” The
Germans stood firm as rocks, and fought as heroes; and the
heavy battle-axe of Charles, wielded with irresistible
strength, spread death and dismay in the Arabian ranks;
the mighty strokes which the Christian hero dealt with that
formidable weapon, gained him the epithet of <em>Martel</em>, the
<em>Hammer</em>. Eudes, burning with the resentment of former
defeats, strove to rival the prowess of his ally. Still, for
many hours, the balance hung equipoised. The life-blood
of thousands of Christians and thousands of Moslems, that
had ere just raced so fiercely through its channels, mingled
in sluggish streams on the ground. Evening set in, and
still the contest raged with unabated fury; the Orientals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
had, indeed, repeatedly been forced to give way to the
superior weight and strength of the Germans but their
heroic chief had as often rallied them and led them on again
to death and glory. At length, a German spear struck him
to death: his fall decided the fate of the battle; the
Saracens, disheartened by the loss of their great commander,
retired to their camp. There was no leader left among
them of sufficient renown and authority to replace the
fallen hero; despairing of their ability to renew the fight
next day with the slightest chance of success, they resolved
upon a hasty retreat; and taking with them the richest
and most portable portion of their spoil, they abandoned
their camp in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Next morning, when Charles was marshalling forth his
troops to renew the contest, his spies both surprised and
rejoiced him with the welcome intelligence that the enemy
were in full retreat to the south. The victory gained was
decisive and final: the torrent of Arabian conquest was rolled
back; and Europe was rescued from the threatened yoke of
the Saracens. But the losses of the Christians also had been
very great, and Charles wisely declined incurring with his
sadly diminished forces, the possible mischances of a pursuit.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Leaving to Eudes the task of reconquering his own land
from the flying foe, Charles proceeded now to call the
Burgundian nobles to account for their hesitation and lukewarmness
in his cause. To secure their future allegiance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
he placed officers of his into the Burgundian cities and
castles; to little purpose, however, it would appear, as their
presence did not prevent the discontented Burgundian
nobles, a few years after, from calling in the Saracens, and
actually delivering the city of Avignon into the hands of
<span class="smcap">Jussuf Ben Abdalrahman</span>, the Arabian governor of
Narbonne (735).</p>

<p>In 734, Charles defeated Poppo, the Duke of the Frisons,
and regained the western part of Friesland. In 735, Duke
Eudes died, and as his two sons, <span class="smcap">Hunold</span> and <span class="smcap">Hatto</span>,
quarrelled about the succession, Charles proffered his
“armed mediation,” and settled the dispute finally by
naming Hunold Duke of Aquitaine, after having exacted and
obtained from that prince an oath of allegiance, not to the
nominal king of the Franks, but to himself personally, and
to his two sons of his first marriage, Carloman and Pepin.
In 736, Charles had to repel another invasion of the
Saxons, which prevented him from proceeding to Burgundy
against the disaffected nobles and their allies, the Arabs;
he sent, however, his brother Childebrand. In 737, he
came himself; he speedily reduced Avignon, and expelled
the Arabs from the Burgundian territory; the nobility and
clergy, who had treasonably conspired against him with the
enemy, or had acted in a hostile manner to him, he
deprived of their possessions, bishoprics, &amp;c., which he
bestowed upon his friends and followers.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In 738 he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
advanced into Septimania, and laid siege to Narbonne.
He totally defeated Omar Ben Kaled, the Arabian general,
who was marching to the relief of <ins class="corr" id="tn-124" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the beleagured city'">
the beleaguered city</ins>; but the governor of Narbonne defended the place so valiantly
and successfully, that the Franks were compelled to raise
the siege. However, though Septimania remained in the
hands of the Arabs till 755, when Pepin, the son of Charles
Martel, recovered it, an effectual and final check had been
put to their further advance into France.</p>

<p>In 737, King Thierry died; but so firmly was the power
of Charles Martel established now, that he could safely
neglect to name a successor to the dead “monarch;” nay,
in 741, he actually proceeded before a general assembly of
the nobility and the army, to divide his dominions between
his two sons of his first marriage (with Rotrudis), bestowing
Austrasia, with Suabia and Thuringia, upon the elder,
Carloman; Neustria, Burgundy, and Provence, upon the
younger, Pepin. His son Grypho, whom Suanehilda had
borne him, he excluded at first from all participation in his
succession; subsequently he assigned him also a portion,
which, after his death, led to the oppression and imprisonment
of the youth by his elder brothers. In the same year
(741) Charles was, on his return from a kind of pilgrimage
to St. Denys, seized with a violent fever, of which he died
at Carisiacum, or Quiercy, on the Oise, on the 22nd
October.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="label">[102]</a> Better known as Boniface, the Apostle of the Germans. He was
sent by Charles to Rome to obtain the episcopal ordination, that he
might be able to act with greater ecclesiastical authority in the newly
converted districts; on the 30th November, 723, Pope Gregory II.
(715-731) ordained him bishop, after he had given in his “profession
of faith,” which was approved of by Gregory as strictly orthodox. The
pope furnished him then with letters and credentials to Christian
princes and ecclesiastics, and to the heathen princes and nations of
Germany, and also with faithful copies of the ordinances, creed, ritual,
and regulations of the Romish Church; and the Christian missionary
was thus converted into the Popish legate. By his base monkish
truckling to the authority of Rome this narrow-minded zealot, who
sought in idle formalities and ceremonies the <em>spirit</em> of the word of
Christ, which he was totally unable to conceive and comprehend, turned
the new Christian church in Germany into a dependence of the Papal
see, and thus prepared ages of bloodshed and misery for that devoted
country. He carried his “submissiveness” to Rome so far that he
actually asked instructions in that quarter as to whether, on which
part of the body, and with which finger he might, or was to, make the
sign of the cross during the delivery of his sermons. No wonder,
indeed, his “mission” succeeded only when backed by the sword. He
was murdered by the Frisons, in 755. Apart from his narrow-minded
bigotry, he was an estimable man, full of honest and disinterested zeal.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[103]</a> The ingenuity displayed by man in the invention of specious

<p><a id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108" class="label">[108]</a> The idle and incredibly extravagant tale told by Paul Warnefried
and Anastasius of 350,000 or 375,000 Arabs slain in this battle, to
1500 Christians, has been faithfully copied by most historians. One
should think a moment’s reflection would suffice to show the
absolute impossibility of these numbers. Where on earth was a
governor of Spain, a recent conquest of the Saracens, to find the
450,000 men (for 100,000 are stated to have escaped) to lead into
France; and where was he to find, in a thinly populated region, such
as that country was in the time of Charles Martel, the means of
subsistence for such a host? His chief of the commissariat must have
been a rare genius indeed. And as to the number of <em>fifteen hundred</em>
Christians slain, this looks very much like the “one man killed and
four men slightly wounded,” to “one thousand of the enemy slain,”
of some of our modern bulletins. Striking off a nought from the
number of the Saracens, and adding one to that of the Christians may
bring us somewhat nearer the truth.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="label">[109]</a> Charles Martel was not over-nice, it would appear, in the bestowal
of ecclesiastical preferments and estates; it mattered very little indeed
to him whether the recipient was a priest or a layman, or even whether
he could read and write. He also laid his impious hands repeatedly
upon the revenues of the church, and applied them to the necessities
of the state, or to pay his soldiers. No wonder then that a sainted
bishop of the times, <span class="smcap">Eucherius</span>, of Orleans, should have been indulged
with a pleasant vision of the body and soul of the wicked prince
burning in the deepest abyss of hell&mdash;rather scurvy treatment,
though, on the part of a Christian clergy, of a prince who, whatever
might be his foibles as a man, and his vices as a king&mdash;(and it must be
admitted, he had a goodly share of them)&mdash;had yet the merit of being
the saviour of Christendom. (A synod held at Quiercy, in 858, had the
calm impudence to communicate this interesting and flattering statement,
accompanied by some others of the same stamp, to Lewis, King
of Germany, grandson of Charlemagne!)</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
